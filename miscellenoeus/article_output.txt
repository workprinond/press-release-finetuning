Munich. BMW M Motorsport's support programme for customer racing enters its second round in 2026. In an intensive selection process held in Munich (GER), twelve candidates from ten nations applied for a spot in the "Class of 2026" of the BMW M Racing Academy. Ultimately, BMW M Motorsport officials selected three drivers who will benefit from an exclusive programme next year: German Thomas Rackl, American Josh Green, and Australian Ryder Quinn. Following the successful completion of the "Class of 2025," which included Berkay Besler (TUR), Nerea Martí (ESP), Matt Million (USA), and Niels Tröger (GER), the two-day screening of candidates for the second season of the BMW M Racing Academy took place at the end of October. Twelve young talents, aiming to drive the BMW M4 GT4 in the upcoming customer racing season, were selected from a large pool of applicants to face various challenges in Munich under the watchful eyes of BMW M Motorsport officials. They underwent practical driving contests in BMW M models guided by the BMW M Driving Experience, mental and fitness tests conducted by Formula Medicine experts, an Esports challenge on the racing simulator, as well as driver and media interviews. The candidates' performances were observed and evaluated not only by experts from the respective fields but also by the three mentors of the BMW M Racing Academy – BMW M works drivers Jens Klingmann, Max Hesse (both GER), and Robby Foley (USA). This trio had already served as advisors during the "Class of 2025," providing valuable insights into the work of professional racing drivers. Klingmann, Hesse, and Foley will intensify their roles in 2026. Three drivers from three continents were selected for the "Class of 2026." Representing Germany is Thomas Rackl. The 17-year-old competed for the ME Motorsport Team in the ADAC GT4 Germany over the past two seasons. In 2025, he finished seventh overall and fifth in the junior standings in the BMW M4 GT4 EVO alongside Linus Hahne (GER). In 2023, he secured second place in the German Kart Championship.
