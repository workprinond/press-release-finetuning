DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
============================================================

TRADE-OFFS ANALYSIS:
1. Model Size vs. Performance: The reduced model trades a slight decrease in
   performance (higher perplexity) for increased training and inference speed.
2. Training Speed: Removing a transformer block typically results in ~15-25%
   faster training due to fewer parameters and computations.
3. Output Quality: The original model generally produces more coherent and
   contextually appropriate text, while the reduced model may show slightly
   more repetition or less nuanced responses.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. For production with strict latency requirements: Consider the reduced model.
2. For maximum text quality: Use the original model.
3. For resource-constrained environments: The reduced model offers better
   efficiency with acceptable performance degradation.

NEXT STEPS WITH MORE RESOURCES:
1. Experiment with removing different transformer blocks (not just the last).
2. Try progressive layer dropping or other adaptive pruning techniques.
3. Increase training data and perform hyperparameter optimization.
4. Test with larger batch sizes and more epochs.
5. Evaluate on more diverse and challenging BMW-related tasks.
