H2: Small cars have always been a tough sell in the United States, where they’re typically seen as bare-bones transportation for those on a limited budget rather than as a space-saving, fuel-efficient choice for those who simply prefer a smaller, lighter vehicle. In 2002, the BMW Group upended that notion with the MINI Cooper, a car that was not only small and efficient but fun to drive, premium, and—above all—quirky. The MINI Cooper became a surprise hit in this market, and those who bought it became not just customers but a community.

H1: BMW NA 50th Anniversary | 50 Stories for 50 Years Chapter 33: “Just for U.S.: BMW of North America Creates Special Models with Enhanced Enthusiast Appeal”
H2: BMW of North America’s customers have always been more performance-minded than their counterparts in other markets, but the cars sold here haven’t always been as performance-oriented as those customers might have liked. In the 1970s and ’80s, strict U.S. crash and emissions standards ensured that cars sold here were heavier and less powerful than their counterparts in Europe, which saw U.S. enthusiasts turn to the so-called “grey market” in order to get BMW’s highest-performing models. Today, crash and emissions standards are much more uniform worldwide, but that doesn’t negate the cost to federally certify a car for sale. That cost needs to be absorbed into the business case for every model, and it can prevent some of BMW’s most alluring cars from reaching the U.S. market.
