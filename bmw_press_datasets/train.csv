BMW NA 50th Anniversary | 50 Stories for 50 Years Chapter 33: “Just for U.S.: BMW of North America Creates Special Models with Enhanced Enthusiast Appeal”,"BMW of North America’s customers have always been more performance-minded than their counterparts in other markets, but the cars sold here haven’t always been as performance-oriented as those customers might have liked. In the 1970s and ’80s, strict U.S. crash and emissions standards ensured that cars sold here were heavier and less powerful than their counterparts in Europe, which saw U.S. enthusiasts turn to the so-called “grey market” in order to get BMW’s highest-performing models. Today, crash and emissions standards are much more uniform worldwide, but that doesn’t negate the cost to federally certify a car for sale. That cost needs to be absorbed into the business case for every model, and it can prevent some of BMW’s most alluring cars from reaching the U.S. market.",Thomas Plucinsky BMW Group,2025-08-19,https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/pressclub/p/us/pressDetail.html?title=bmw-na-50th-anniversary-%7c-50-stories-for-50-years-chapter-33-just-for-u-s-bmw-of-north-america&outputChannelId=9&id=T0451994EN_US&left_menu_item=node__806,T0451994EN_US,14808,22
