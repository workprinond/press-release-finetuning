# Steyr goes electric: BMW Group launches series production of electric engines for Neue Klasse
## +++ First-ever electric engines from Plant Steyr +++ Board Member Nedeljković: “Laying the foundations for the future” +++ Gen6 electric engines for Neue Klasse +++ Technology openness as competitive advantage +++
Date: 2025-08-01 | Author: Christian Marxt BMW Group | ID: T0451903EN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Munich/Steyr (Austria). The BMW Group Plant Steyr today began series production of the e-engine for the Neue Klasse. “Today, we are laying the foundations for the future of the BMW Group,” explained Milan Nedeljković, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG responsible for Production. “As the first production site for the Gen6 electric engine, Plant Steyr is central to the Neue Klasse and the continued development of our global production network.” The electric engine for the sixth generation of BMW eDrive (Gen6) is the first fully-electric drive train to be produced at the Steyr location in Austria. From there, it will be shipped throughout the production network, providing the drive train for the Neue Klasse. “Three years ago, we announced that we would build this electric engine in Steyr. Today, we are proud to deliver it,” said Klaus von Moltke, SVP of Engine Production for BMW AG and plant director of the Steyr facility. “What we are launching here today is more than just a production ramp-up. It is a firm commitment to Europe, to technology and to the future.”

Technology openness: Plant Steyr as centre of drive train expertise

Between the project launch in 2022 and 2030, the BMW Group is investing over one billion euros in expanding development and production expertise for e-drives at the Steyr location. This capacity expansion will ensure the plant remains the BMW Group's leading location for drive trains. For over 40 years, the plant has developed and manufactured internal combustion engines for the BMW and MINI brands. This extensive experience and wealth of expertise in drive trains make the engine plant the ideal facility to produce the Gen6 electric engines. The site will continue to manufacture diesel and petrol engines in parallel. “Technology openness is our strength – it gives us the necessary flexibility to secure long-term jobs,” said von Moltke. [ADDRESS],000 employees will work in the new electric engine assembly. Depending on global demand, half of the Steyr location’s total workforce could be employed in e-mobility by 2030. von Moltke: “Steyr will remain the heart of our drive train expertise – both for combustion engines and electromobility.”

Powertrain components produced in Steyr, aluminium housings from Landshut

Rotor, stator, transmission and inverter – all core components of the innovative, highly integrated e-drive – will be manufactured at Plant Steyr. The housing for the electric engine will be cast at Plant Landshut's aluminium foundry and further processed in Steyr. The inverter will be produced in a new in-house clean-room environment, marking the Austrian engine manufacturer’s entry into the field of electrical engineering. E-drive components from Steyr will be assembled on two new lines. The overall production concept for the Gen6 e-drive follows the principle of a modular system, making it possible to produce different highly flexible electric drive train derivatives for the entire range of Neue Klasse models. The modular concept generates positive economies of scale and cost savings in both development and production. It also improves the scalability of production volumes and keeps production, supply networks and procurement highly flexible.

Comprehensive improvements to electric engine

The electric engine has undergone significant further development for Gen6: The rotor, stator and inverter have all been holistically designed for the Gen6 technology’s new 800-volt architecture, maximising performance capabilities and the efficiency of the drive system. In the inverter, 800-volt technology and silicon carbide (SiC) semiconductor technology are now being used to boost efficiency. Fully integrated into the electric engine housing, the inverter converts direct current from the high-voltage battery into alternating current for the electric engine.

Lower weight, costs and energy loss lead to greater vehicle efficiency

Overall, the intelligent use of new technologies in the e-drive and systematic further development of existing systems produce remarkable results. Comparing the future BMW iX3 50 xDrive with a Gen5 xDrive model shows the following improvements in the electric engine: “Energy loss is reduced by 40 percent, costs by 20 percent and weight by 10 percent. All this makes a significant contribution to the approximately 20-percent increase in overall vehicle efficiency”, explains Martin Kaufmann, SVP of global Powertrain Development at BMW AG. The efficient design of the powertrain together with the high energy content of the high-voltage battery, enable a range of up to 800 km (WLTP) in the BMW iX3 50 xDrive, the first model of the Neue Klasse.

Munich. Familiar names and a strong new addition as the rider lineup for the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team for the 2025 FIM Endurance World Championship (FIM EWC) is set. South African Steven Odendaal will join the regular riders Markus Reiterberger (GER) and Sylvain Guintoli (FRA). Estonian Hannes Soomer will also be ready again as the fourth rider for the 2025 season.

31-year-old Odendaal has been a permanent fixture in the FIM EWC paddock since 2022, making him a true endurance expert. Previously, he was the overall runner-up in the 2021 FIM Supersport World Championship, competed for eight years in the Moto2 World Championship, and won the Moto2 European Championship in 2016.

Reiterberger has been deeply rooted in BMW Motorrad Motorsport’s FIM EWC project from the beginning and will enter his sixth season with the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team in 2025. Guintoli, the 2014 Superbike World Champion and 2021 FIM EWC World Champion, joined team manager Werner Daemen’s squad for the 2024 season. For Soomer, it will also be his second year in the team and on the #37 BMW M 1000 RR.

Sven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “With this strong rider lineup, we have assembled an important part of our overall package for the FIM EWC 2025. Our clear goal is to become world champions in endurance racing after winning the title in the FIM World Superbike Championship. With our quartet of riders, we are well-prepared for this. Markus Reiterberger has been a key part of the success story of the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team from the very beginning. Sylvain Guintoli has been a very important part of the project since last season with all his skill and experience. Newcomer Steven Odendaal has also already made a successful name for himself in the FIM EWC. Additionally, we have a strong fourth rider in Hannes Soomer, who has settled in excellently in his first year on the BMW M 1000 RR and at BMW Motorrad Motorsport. At the same time, we would like to thank Ilya Mikhalchik for his long-standing commitment to the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team. He has also been instrumental in shaping the team from the beginning and setting it on the path to success.”

Werner Daemen, Team Manager BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “With our rider lineup, we are well-prepared to enter the title fight in 2025. Markus is our stalwart, and we are excited to enter our sixth FIM EWC season together with him. Sylvain was a great addition to our team in 2024, and it’s fantastic that our collaboration with him continues. Our new addition Steven has already been testing with us, and he has quickly settled into the team. In Hannes, we have a strong fourth rider who made a great contribution to the team last year. However, in an endurance team, it’s not just about speed and skill, but also team spirit – and that’s an aspect that distinguishes our quartet. Unfortunately, Ilya will no longer be with us. I thank him for the many years together and wish him success in the future.”

Doha. On the weekend before the season opener of the FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC) in Qatar, four BMW M Motorsport cars completed numerous test laps during the Prologue at the Lusail Circuit. The BMW M Hybrid V8 made a strong impression and set the fastest time. The two hypercars and the two BMW M4 GT3 EVOs were presented for the first time in their new designs .

On Friday and Saturday, the two BMW M Team WRT hypercars completed more than 700 laps. Robin Frijns (NED) was the fastest in the #20 Shell BMW M Hybrid V8, achieving the overall best time in the fourth and final test session in 1:38.971 minutes. The #15 sister car ranked fourth. In the LMGT3 class, the #31 and #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVOs completed more than 650 laps. In the overall ranking of the four sessions, the two cars ended up tenth and eleventh.

Both hypercars will enter their second FIA WEC season in 2025 in the new Inception design by BMW M Motorsport. Car #15 will sport the traditional BMW M colours, while car #20 will feature the colours of Premium Technology Partner Shell.

Comments before the Qatar 1812 KM:

Andreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “Our goals for our second FIA WEC season are ambitious. We aim to build on the clear upward trend from the second half of the 2024 season and be in a position to consistently compete for podium places with our BMW M Hybrid V8. This applies to the entire season, but especially for the major highlight at Le Mans. Here in Qatar, we want to start the year with good results. During the prologue, we focused on running through our intensive test programme and gathering important information. Finishing with the fastest time is always nice, and we’re heading into race week with a positive mindset. In the LMGT3 class, we are looking forward to the debut of the new BMW M4 GT3 EVO. The car has won its first two races, demonstrating its great potential. The clear season goal is to contend for the World Championship title and a victory at Le Mans.”

Vincent Vosse (Team Principal BMW M Team WRT): “So far, I think, we have a good working base. We gathered good and important information. I am quite happy. We did not have any major issues with the cars. Of course, there is still some work to be done but overall, we are quite satisfied.”

Kevin Magnussen (BMW M Team WRT, #15 BMW M Hybrid V8): “We were following the plan. I got many laps but of course it’s testing and you never know how competitive you are so we were just focusing on the programme. Things are running according to plan and we keep working. Now I’m looking forward to the race.”

Robin Frijns (BMW M Team WRT, #20 Shell BMW M Hybrid V8): “I think it went alright. We had a test programme before arriving at Qatar, we followed it pretty much and everything feels fine. Now we need to put the puzzle together and prepare ourselves for the race which is a bit different. As we don’t drive at night during FP1 and FP2, Saturday was our only opportunity so that was quite important for us. Now it’s all about discussions and see how we can improve the package we have for the race.”

Augusto Farfus (The Bend Team WRT, #31 BMW M4 GT3 EVO): “The track here has a big evolution across the weekend by having a lot of sand on the first day so it’s our job to understand the track evolution and the tyre evolution. This year, we are racing with a brand-new EVO car so we also have a lot to learn on that side. Overall it’s good to be back in the FIA WEC paddock and also to get to know my new teammates. It has been the first time that I met them and we have a good spirit. So let’s get everything ready for the big one.”

Valentino Rossi (Team WRT, #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO): “First of all, it was good to have two days of testing before the start of the season because you have a bit of time to work on the car, other than during the race. I think that we improved a lot from Friday to Saturday and the feeling is not so bad. The tyre consumption makes a big difference here, so we tried a lot of things to improve this aspect that was a bit difficult for us sometimes in the past. Overall, it is difficult to understand where we are at the moment. We need to wait for the race. But on Saturday I felt comfortable with the car, I was able to drive a double stint and my pace was good so it is positive and the team always works hard. We are not the fastest yet, we need to improve but we are on a good way.”

# The first-ever BMW M3 CS Touring: Racing DNA meets maximised everyday usability.
## With the first-ever BMW M3 CS Touring (fuel consumption combined: 10.5 l/100 km [26.9 mpg imp]; CO2 emissions combined: 238 g/km in the WLTP cycle, CO2 class: G), BMW M GmbH is adding another special-edition model to its line-up in the high-performance sports car segment. The latest new addition to the manufacturer’s most popular range builds on the success of the BMW M3 Competition Touring with M xDrive (fuel consumption combined: 10.4 l/100 km [27.2 mpg imp]; CO2 emissions combined: 235 g/km in the WLTP cycle, CO2 class: G) and blends that car’s very distinctive character profile with even greater potential for emotionally exhilarating performance. A 405 kW/550 hp six-cylinder in-line engine, bespoke chassis tuning, exclusive design features and weight savings resulting from the use of numerous carbon fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP) components provide the ingredients for an unadulterated racing-car feeling. The on-board space of the first-ever BMW M3 CS Touring can be used in a wide variety of ways, which ensures that its ultra-dynamic driving characteristics can be experienced both on the race track and in myriad everyday situations, during leisure activities and on trips away.
Date: 2025-01-30 | Author: Christian Pomp BMW Group | ID: T0447610EN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The model-specific performance characteristics of the engine and power transfer via the eight-speed M Steptronic transmission and M xDrive all-wheel-drive system serve up dynamic thrills and supreme traction. The BMW M3 CS Touring races from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 3.5 seconds.

The world premiere of the first-ever BMW M3 CS Touring will be hosted by the Mount Panorama Circuit in Bathurst, in the Australian state of New South Wales. The BMW M3 CS Touring will be revealed to the public for the first time on 30 January 2025 as part of the [ADDRESS] Hour race programme. Deliveries of the limited-run model to customers in Europe, Australia, Japan and South Korea, among others, will begin in March 2025. The car’s home market of Germany is by a distance its most important sales region. The special edition will be produced alongside all other variants of the BMW M3 Sedan and BMW M3 Touring at BMW Group Plant Munich.

Six-cylinder in-line engine adapts racing-car technology.

[ADDRESS].0-litre six-cylinder in-line engine in the BMW M3 CS Touring was designed from the outset to deliver high performance on the race track – and it features a multitude of technological details from racing-car design. These include an extremely rigid crankcase with a sleeve-free, closed-deck construction, a forged lightweight crankshaft and a cylinder head with a 3D-printed core. The likewise weight-saving cylinder bores have a wire-arc sprayed iron coating to reduce frictional losses. The cooling system and oil supply are also designed to handle the sustained heavy loads generated during hard driving on a track.

The drive unit combines the high-revving characteristics for which M is renowned and linear power delivery into the upper reaches of the engine’s range with upgraded M TwinTurbo technology. Raising the maximum charge pressure of the two mono-scroll turbochargers to 2.1 bar and making model-specific tweaks to the engine management enable the maximum output of the BMW M3 Competition Touring with M xDrive to be increased by another 15 kW/20 hp to 405 kW/550 hp. The engine develops its peak torque of 650 Nm (479 lb-ft) between just 2,750 and 5,950 rpm, produces its maximum output at 6,250 rpm and tops out at 7,200 rpm.

In addition, a specially designed engine mounting with increased spring rates creates an extremely rigid connection between the power unit and the vehicle’s structure. This leads to even sharper engine response and extremely direct transmission of its power to the drivetrain. Its instantaneous power delivery means the BMW M3 CS Touring can power from rest to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 3.5 seconds, and 0 to 200 km/h (124 mph) is over in 11.7 seconds. The figures recorded using the “one-foot rollout” method* are 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 3.2 seconds and 0 to 200 km/h (124 mph) in 11.4 seconds. The mid-range sprint from 80 to 120 km/h (50 – 75 mph) takes 2.7 seconds in 4th gear and 3.5 seconds in 5th gear. The top speed of the special-edition model – which comes as standard with the M Driver’s Package – is electronically limited to 300 km/h (186 mph).

The car’s emotionally stirring engine note is the work of the M-specific exhaust system featuring electrically controlled flaps, a titanium rear silencer with weight-minimising design and – in customary M fashion – two pairs of tailpipes painted in matt Black. The engine’s acoustic presence varies according to the engine profile the driver selects from the M Setup menu. SPORT or SPORT+ mode produces a drive sound that injects real aural drama into proceedings, particularly through gear changes and the accompanying adjustments in rev speed.

Eight-speed M Steptronic transmission, M xDrive and Active M Differential enable irresistibly dynamic power transfer.

The engine under the bonnet of the BMW M3 CS Touring teams up with an eight-speed M Steptronic transmission including Drivelogic. The Drivelogic button integrated into the gear selector lever makes it possible to alter the transmission’s shift characteristics, with a choice of three clearly distinguishable settings available. As well as comfort-focused and sporty options, drivers can also engage a setting optimised specially for track driving. Both the selector lever and the carbon-fibre shift paddles on the steering wheel enable sequential interventions in the gear selection process.

The BMW M3 CS Touring channels its power to the road through the M xDrive all-wheel-drive system. This employs an electronically controlled multi-plate clutch in the transfer case to ensure fully variable and super-smooth distribution of the engine’s power between the front and rear wheels, and serves up tireless all-wheel-drive performance, even during hard track sessions. In tandem with the Active M Differential at the rear axle – whose operation is also fully variable – the intelligent all-wheel-drive system’s rear-wheel bias enhances the M-typical handling dynamics. Added to which, 4WD Sport mode can be selected via the M Setup menu. This sends an even greater proportion of the engine’s power to the rear wheels. 2WD mode, meanwhile, delivers a driving experience for the ultimate purist, laying on classical rear-wheel drive with the DSC (Dynamic Stability Control) system deactivated.

Model-specific tuning for the chassis technology and performance-focused stopping power.

The chassis technology in the BMW M3 CS Touring has been tuned precisely to the engine’s performance characteristics, the overall vehicle concept and the specific weight distribution of this latest special-edition model. The settings for the DSC system and M Dynamic Mode have also been purposefully optimised for the specific demands of dynamically committed circuit driving. The electronically controlled dampers of the adaptive M suspension on the BMW M3 CS Touring likewise come in a model-specific setup, as do its M Servotronic steering and integrated braking system.

Providing outstanding stopping power are M Compound brakes with callipers painted in a choice of Red or Black. There is also the option of M Carbon ceramic brakes whose brake callipers are available in Red or matt Gold. Also on the standard equipment list are forged M light-alloy wheels in an exclusive double-spoke design with a matt Gold Bronze or matt Black finish. [ADDRESS] inches in diameter at the front axle and 20 inches at the rear, the wheels are fitted as standard with track tyres (275/35 ZR19 at the front, 285/30 ZR20 at the rear). As an alternative to these tyres, customers also have the no-cost option of sport tyres with the same dimensions. And ultra-track tyres are also included on the options list.

Exclusive carbon-fibre components and optimised body rigidity help to produce outstanding performance attributes.

Together with the extremely powerful engine and model-specific chassis technology, intelligent lightweight design measures also play a major part in moulding the exclusive performance attributes of the BMW M3 CS Touring. Extensive use of carbon fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP) is particularly important when it comes to weight minimisation. The car’s bonnet, front splitter, front air intakes, exterior mirror caps and rear diffuser are all made from CFRP.

Inside the cabin, the M Carbon bucket seats and likewise CFRP steering wheel shift paddles, interior trim strips and centre console also do their bit to keep weight down. The various lightweight design measures bring about a total weight saving of some 15 kilograms over the BMW M3 Competition Touring with M xDrive. Body rigidity is further increased by specifying the optional M front end strut brace for the engine compartment that has also been engineered for lightness.

Exquisite balance of performance and everyday usability; exclusive design features.

Hallmark M performance and the versatility-focused body concept of a Touring model certainly make an unusual combination, and the latest special edition adds a special allure to the mix. In the BMW M3 CS Touring, a concentrated dose of M feeling meets a variable-usage interior whose storage capacity below the high-opening tailgate can be expanded from 500 litres to a maximum 1,510 litres. In addition, the dynamically stretched lines of the Touring model and the M-specific exterior details – crafted precisely to meet the technical demands of cooling air supply and aerodynamic balance – are complemented by exclusive design features whose striking appearance reflects the track-leaning instincts of the BMW M3 CS Touring.

For example, the standard-specification exposed carbon fibre of the special-edition’s bonnet, front splitter, front air intakes and M exterior mirror caps creates an eye-catching contrast against the visually striking exterior colours available for the rest of the car. The BMW M3 CS Touring can be ordered with a paint finish in British Racing Green, Laguna Seca Blue, Frozen Solid White or Sapphire Black metallic. The roof and model-specific roof spoiler are in Black high-gloss and bring an impression of elegance to the bold exterior. Another exclusive design feature of the special-edition model is the red surround for the roof spoiler.

The front end of the car is defined by the weight-minimised, ultra-stripped-back and frameless BMW M kidney grille. The black model lettering on the upper of the two horizontal grille slats is bordered by a red contour line, likewise the model badging at the front and rear. In a clear reference to motor sport, the LED headlights of the BMW M3 CS Touring glow with the same distinctive yellow light as GT racing cars.

Driver-focused cockpit with exclusive racing-car aura.

The interior of the BMW M3 CS Touring blends a sports-car cockpit designed to exude maximum performance with digital technology and exclusive design features. Electrically adjustable and heated M Carbon bucket seats are fitted as standard for the driver and front passenger. They have integral head restraints, an illuminated “CS” model badge and surfaces in Merino leather. Their exclusive Black/Red design is also adopted by the rear seats, while all the door panel trim is covered with black leather.

The standard M Alcantara steering wheel in three-spoke design – with its flat-bottomed rim and red centre marker in the 12-o’clock position – brings authentic racing car flair into the cockpit,. Further M-specific details are the red “CS” badge on the centre console, M seat belts and door sill plates with model lettering.

The M-specific Setup button on the centre console enables direct access to the settings for the engine, chassis, steering, brakes and M xDrive. Two individually configurable setup variants can be stored together with personal settings for the engine sound, DSC, Automatic Start/Stop function and the shift characteristics of the eight-speed M Steptronic transmission – and these setups are then selected using the M buttons on the steering wheel. The BMW M3 CS Touring also comes as standard with the M Drive Professional system with track-optimised functions such as the M Drift Analyser and M Laptimer. Added to which, the 10-stage M Traction Control delivers personalised driving fun on the track. Another feature of M Drive Professional is the M Mode button on the centre console, which can be used to configure the driver assistance systems and the content shown on the information display and Head-Up Display. Drivers can choose between ROAD, SPORT and TRACK settings here.

In the new BMW M3 CS Touring, the latest version of the display and control/operation system BMW iDrive based on BMW Operating [ADDRESS].5 provides intuitive control of numerous vehicle functions and digital services. With the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant and BMW Curved Display both on board, the car is based squarely on operation using touch control and natural language. The M-specific view on the 12.3-inch information display shows the familiar M Shift Lights at its upper edge, while the status of the driving stability systems, M xDrive and traction control can be found at the lower edge of the screen. The home screen of the 14.9-inch control display includes widgets for the vehicle setup, tire pressure and temperature.

Sophisticated options for enhancing driving pleasure and comfort in everyday use.

Standard specification for the BMW M3 CS Touring also includes BMW Live Cockpit Professional which, alongside the BMW Head-Up Display with M-specific content, brings the cloud-based navigation system BMW Maps, smartphone integration, telephony with wireless charging and a WiFi interface. The BMW Drive Recorder can be added as an option.

The BMW M3 CS Touring additionally offers customers a selection of comfort-enhancing features and driver assistance systems composed with the focus firmly on the enjoyment of unadulterated driving pleasure. Comfort Access, the alarm system, two-zone automatic climate control and the Harman Kardon Surround Sound System are all fitted as standard. Park Distance Control and the Parking Assistant, Front Collision Warning, Lane Departure Warning and the Speed Limit Info system are likewise standard, while the Driving Assistant system can be specified as an option.

# Centre for Special and Individual Paintwork: A special touch in series production
## +++ BMW Group to invest over 30 million euros in southern extension to Dingolfing paintshop +++ Growing capacity for Individual and special paint finishes on BMW cars +++ Series production and manual painting efficiently combined +++
Date: 2025-08-13 | Author: Thomas Niedermeier BMW Group | ID: T0451943EN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dingolfing. A new Centre for Special and Individual Paintwork is about to be built at BMW Group Plant Dingolfing. Over the next two years, an investment of more than 30 million euros will enable a new, southern extension to the existing paintshop. Construction will commence in September 2025, with the new facility scheduled to go on stream in the spring of 2027.

The forthcoming extension will offer over 2,000 square metres of space across two levels for adding customers’ desired finishes and special paintwork options to even more cars in ever more efficient processes. “It will enable us to meet the growing wishes of customers for something special, and help us develop a lucrative area of business for the BMW Group,” says Plant Director Christoph Schröder.

The paintshop at Dingolfing already offers a particularly wide array of colours, paint types and customisation options, with up to 300 different shades for customers to choose from – plus the two-tone and complex special finishes available for exclusive small series such as the BMW 3.0 CSL or BMW M4 CS Edition VR46.

A defining feature of this area of manufacturing is always the combination of automated processes in series production with individual elements of manual painting. According to Sven Selaskowki, responsible for Painted Bodies at Plant Dingolfing, the new paintline in the forthcoming extension will be equipped to enable exactly that: the first coat of coloured paint will be applied automatically in series production, with special touches – such as stripes or contrast colours on the doors and body for two-tone or custom finishes – added by hand afterwards in the forthcoming extension. Bodies will then return to the series production line for a final coat of clear varnish.

Depending on demand and the number of units needed, the team in the new centre for special paint finishes will comprise upwards of ten people.

Throughput times will fall by about a quarter compared to the current process, and costs per body made will fall noticeably. The drying furnaces in the new extension will run on electricity rather than gas – via power-to-heat.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paris. The artist Raphaëlle Peria and the curator Fanny Robin were named winners of the BMW ART MAKERS programme to develop their project “ Traversée du fragment manquant ”. This artistic project is a new experiment, the result of their collaboration, which will lead to an unprecedented exhibition. This exhibition will be presented as part of two major photography events, the Rencontres d'Arles and Paris Photo. This is part of the long-standing partnerships that BMW is developing with these two cultural platforms.

The jury was composed of Simon Baker, director of the Maison Européenne de la Photographie, Florence Bourgeois, director of Paris Photo, Andreina de Bei, journalist for Sciences et Avenir, Hervé Digne, president of Poush-Manifesto, Chantal Nedjib, founder of L'Image par l'image, Christoph Wiesner, director of Rencontres d'Arles and Maryse Bataillard, head of corporate communication and CSR BMW Group France.

The project: “ Traversée du fragment manquant ” For the BMW ART MAKERS programme, the artist Raphaëlle Peria and the curator Fanny Robin propose a project on the transformation of the territory.

Based on a childhood trip made by the artist on the Canal du Midi, marked by the image and the presence of the plane trees that border the canal and stabilize its banks, the artist returns to this site classified as a UNESCO Heritage Site. Since 2006, the plane trees that dot the landscape have been affected by a disease caused by a microscopic fungus, causing them to wither away. Their absence will profoundly change the landscape.

With “ Traversée du fragment manquant ”, the artist Raphaëlle Peria, who compares her approach to that of an ecologist studying a landscape and how it works, proposes to immortalize this endangered ecosystem by mixing personal archives and current photographs of the banks of the canal. These images are printed on large-format glass plates, unprecedented in her artistic practice. Using a unique engraving and scraping process, she fuses photographs, drawings and prints to illustrate the evolution of this landscape in order to preserve its memory.

Raphaëlle Peria and Fanny Robin declared upon the announcement of their nomination: “A huge thank you to the members of the BMW ART MAKERS programme jury for their confidence in our project. This programme recognizes our partnership started several years ago and will allow us to go further in the research and experimentation of new forms and new materials. This project, which we want to be unique and daring, and which will be thanks to the support and guidance of the BMW teams, is a real opportunity to explore and engage in new directions. With ‘ Traversée du fragment manquant ’ we invite viewers to experience a poetic escape, at the heart of the photographic image”.

The BMW ART MAKERS programme will make this project possible.“We believe that the association of an artist and a curator is key to giving birth to large-scale projects, from the first idea to the final work. We believe that dialogue and diverse perspectives are essential for creation and innovation. We give artists total creative freedom, while providing the artistic and technical expertise of our network. With the decisive support of the BMW ART MAKERS programme, this ambitious project will be able to fully materialize and shine on the national and international artistic scene” - Maryse Bataillard, Head of Corporate Communication and CSR, BMW Group France.

More than 180 applications received for this new edition. Each year, the projects received during the call for applications reflect the trends and topics invested by artists. Among more than 180 applications submitted, the six selected finalist duos had to provide a note of intent, a budget, a production schedule, a scenography proposal and images of their previous work.

These projects presented revealed a great diversity of profiles and works, with 55% of mixed-gender duos, 35% of female duos and 10% of male duos. 58% of the duos were French, 42% were international, coming from more than 26 countries.

Several major trends have emerged, reflecting current societal challenges. Numerous proposals addressed themes related to the environment and ecological transition, inviting contemplation and meditation on the relationship between man and nature. Other projects have addressed issues of post-colonialism, ethnography, and endangered cultural traditions. The inclusion and visibility of minorities were also addressed, in particular through the theme of migrants. Finally, the scenography revealed a strong trend towards immersive exhibitions, using new technologies such as artificial intelligence and augmented reality, often accompanied by sound or light devices.

The first selection of projects was carried out by a pre-jury of visual arts professionals composed of Fabienne Bideaud, curator and art historian, Karin Hemar, creator and consultant in creative strategy, co-president of Les Filles de la Photo, Fabrice Laroche, professor referent at Gobelins, l ‘école de l ‘Image, Maud Prangey, consultant in images and contemporary art, and Maryse Bataillard, head of the corporate communication and CSR, BMW Group France.

The pre-jury allowed 6 nominated artist-curator duos to be auditioned during an interview in front of the jury

# FIA WEC: Fifth place for the #20 Shell BMW M Hybrid V8 at the 6-hour race in São Paulo.
## +++ René Rast, Sheldon van der Linde, and Marco Wittmann deliver a consistently strong performance in Brazil +++ Sheldon van der Linde secures fifth place for the #20 Shell BMW M Hybrid V8 with a late overtaking manoeuvre +++ Challenging home race for Augusto Farfus and Pedro Ebrahim, but the LMGT3 crews show fighting spirit +++

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
São Paulo. BMW M Team WRT secured fifth place with the #20 Shell BMW M Hybrid V8 at the fifth round of the FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC) in São Paulo (BRA). René Rast (GER), Sheldon van der Linde (RSA), and Marco Wittmann (GER) delivered strong performances both in qualifying, where they achieved fifth place, and in the 6-hour race. The #15 BMW M Hybrid V8 fell back early in the race due to technical issues. In the LMGT3 class, both BMW M4 GT3 EVO crews demonstrated fighting spirit in a challenging race.

Sheldon van der Linde drove the qualifying session on Saturday, stepping in for Robin Frijns (NED), who was competing in Formula E at the same time, and secured fifth on the grid. During the race, car #20 consistently remained in the front midfield but was slightly set back by a drive-through penalty. In the final stint, van der Linde closed the gap to the Peugeot ahead and secured fifth place with an impressive overtaking manoeuvre shortly before the finish. Wittmann, returning to the FIA WEC, proved to be an excellent substitute for Frijns. The #15 BMW M Hybrid V8, driven by Kevin Magnussen (DEN), Raffaele Marciello (SUI), and Dries Vanthoor (BEL), started from eighth place but had to return to the pits after just a few laps due to brake issues. Following a 45-minute repair, the trio finished the race in 17th place.

In the LMGT3 class, the two BMW M4 GT3 EVOs were unable to keep up with the leaders throughout the weekend. Despite flawless performances and the determination of the drivers and teams, they could not overcome the deficit. Starting from 14th and 17th on the grid, the best results in the race were tenth place for car #46 and twelfth for the #31 car.

Comments after the race:

Andreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): "Congratulations to BMW M Team WRT and the car #20 crew on a strong weekend. Sheldon van der Linde impressed in qualifying and with his spectacular overtaking manoeuvre against the Peugeot at the end. René Rast delivered two excellent opening stints, and Marco Wittmann was an outstanding substitute for Robin Frijns. It was a solid performance, and we extracted the maximum that was possible for us here. The early brake issues with car #15 are very frustrating and unfortunate for the drivers and the team. We will thoroughly analyse this afterwards. I feel sorry for our LMGT3 crews. They showed great fighting spirit during the race, but ultimately, given the performance levels of the different cars this weekend, we had no chance of achieving top positions. This is especially bitter for Augusto Farfus and Pedro Ebrahim at their home race. Many thanks to everyone involved for their efforts! Now, after some intense weeks, we’ll take a breather and aim to come back even stronger at the next race in Austin."

Vincent Vosse (Team Principal, BMW M Team WRT): "Fifth place for car #20 is the result of an almost flawless race by our team. Even without the drive-through penalty, there wasn’t more in it. That made us the ‘best of the rest’ here. That’s good, but we want to be on the podium. Unfortunately, it wasn’t enough this time. We’ll need to carefully analyse the cause of the brake issues with car #15. At the moment, we can’t say anything definitive. In the LMGT3 class, we probably had the best-executed races we’ve ever had in the FIA WEC with both cars. Finishing tenth and twelfth says it all, I think."

René Rast (BMW M Team WRT, #20 Shell BMW M Hybrid V8, 5th place): "We can be satisfied with the result. It was a calm weekend. We got the maximum out of it; there wasn’t more in it. Our pace wasn’t where we wanted it to be, but we were error-free and had a good strategy. Overall, it’s fine, but unfortunately, we were still a bit too slow this time."

Kevin Magnussen (BMW M Team WRT, #15 BMW M Hybrid V8, 17th place): "It was an unfortunate race for us. The brake issue took away all our chances very early on. Unfortunately, these things can happen. We’ve had some bad luck a few times this season. Hopefully, we can bounce back in the remaining races."

Valentino Rossi (Team WRT, #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, 10th place): "Of course, tenth place isn’t what we came for. We wanted more, we wanted to fight for the podium, but considering our pace and how much we struggled in practice, it’s not bad. The race was good; we didn’t make any mistakes, and the team did a great job. We got the best possible result. But it is what it is. Everyone gave their maximum, even if the performance and pace weren’t fantastic. We’ll push again next time."

Augusto Farfus (The Bend Team WRT, #31 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, 12th place): "It’s incredibly frustrating when you and your crew deliver a perfect race and simply have no chance to keep up with the leaders. Unfortunately, this was evident throughout the weekend. I loved racing in front of my fans in my home country again, but I would have liked to present myself as more competitive on the track. Under the given circumstances, that was impossible."

Long Beach. In terms of qualifying speed, the BMW M Hybrid V8 remains the benchmark in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship (IWSC) season after three races. Dries Vanthoor (BEL) completed the pole position hat-trick at the street circuit in Long Beach (USA), following Daytona and Sebring (both USA), driving car number 24. In the race, Vanthoor's teammate Philipp Eng (AUT) crossed the finish line in third place after 100 minutes, securing the first podium for BMW M Team RLL this season. Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) and Marco Wittmann (GER) finished fifth in the sister car after a strong comeback .

In qualifying, Vanthoor once again shone with an impressive lap time that secured him the pole position. Only van der Linde in the #25 BMW M Hybrid V8 could match the pace, finishing second to complete the front row entirely in BMW M Motorsport's hands. In the race, both BMW M Team RLL cars initially took the lead, but they lost valuable positions during a pit stop in the first yellow phase. Particularly Wittmann, who took over the number 25 from van der Linde, had to fight hard to move up from tenth to fifth place. Eng only had to let the two Porsches at the front go and ultimately drove home a solid third place.

In the GTD class, Turner Motorsport competed with the #96 BMW M4 GT3 EVO. BMW M works driver Robby Foley and Patrick Gallagher (both USA) finished in fifth place.

Comments after the race:

Andreas Roos, Head of BMW M Motorsport: “The third pole position in the third race of the season for Dries Vanthoor and the complete front row in BMW M Motorsport's hands – that was fantastic. We have the speed, but unfortunately, we were not completely error-free in the race, which cost us the chance of winning. We lost valuable positions during the pit stops. Nevertheless, the first podium of the season for Dries Vanthoor and Philipp Eng is a success we can build on. The comeback by Marco Wittmann and Sheldon van der Linde after losing time during the pit stop was strong. Now we need to work even harder to convert our pace into the first win of the season next time.”

Philipp Eng (#24 BMW M Hybrid V8, BMW M Team RLL, 3 rd place): “Starting from the first and second positions, this is obviously not the result we had hoped for. Unfortunately, we had a small issue during the pit stop, which caused us to fall behind the two Porsches. If we had stayed ahead, I think we could have kept them behind us. It's still a podium, but it's a pity because more was possible. Nevertheless, we are on the right track, and we will come back stronger in Laguna Seca.”

Marco Wittmann (#25 BMW M Hybrid V8, BMW M Team RLL, 5 th place): “Even though I managed a good comeback to fifth place, the disappointment prevails after this result. We were in first and second place in all practices and qualifying, so you naturally expect more than third and fifth places in the race. We made a strategic mistake with the timing of our pit stop during the yellow phase with our number 25, which almost threw us to the back of the GTP field. We need to learn from this and convert the strong pace that the BMW M Hybrid V8 has into top results next time.”

Spartanburg, S.C. – Three models assembled at BMW Manufacturing recently earned awards in the prestigious J. D. Power U.S. Initial Quality Study (IQS) SM and J.D. Power U.S. Automotive Performance, Execution, and Layout (APEAL) Study SM .

The BMW X6 (Upper Midsize Premium SUV) and BMW X7 (Large Premium SUV) ranked highest in their segments in the J.D. Power U.S. IQS announced in June. Meanwhile, the BMW X4 (Compact Premium SUV) and BMW X6 (Upper Midsize Premium SUV) took top honors in their segments in the J.D. Power U.S. APEAL Study announced on Thursday. In fact, the BMW X6 was the highest-ranking individual model in the J.D. Power U.S. APEAL Study. This is also the third consecutive year that the BMW X4 won its segment.

“Assembling premium quality BMWs for our customers is our highest priority, and these awards reflect the valuable contributions of our associates, suppliers, and contractors,” said Dr. Robert Engelhorn, president and CEO of BMW Manufacturing.

“After more than 30 years of success, we continue to invest in the United States as we prepare for the assembly of our first fully electric Sports Activity Vehicle.”

The BMW Group announced in late 2022 that it would invest an additional $1.7 billion in its U.S. operations, including $1 billion to prepare the Spartanburg plant to assemble fully electric vehicles and $700 million to build a new high-voltage battery assembly plant in Woodruff. Plant Woodruff construction is complete, and all equipment has been installed. Associates are now preparing the first pre-series battery modules at the plant. In late 2026, Plant Woodruff will start assembly of the sixth-generation battery modules to supply fully electric vehicles at Plant Spartanburg. By 2030, at least six fully electric models will be assembled in the United States.

“Plant Spartanburg will soon contribute to BMW’s technology openness strategy by assembling three different drivetrains at our site: fully electric, plug-in hybrid, and highly efficient internal combustion engines,” said Dr. Engelhorn. “This approach allows customers in different regions to choose the mobility solution that is best for their individual needs.”

Impact of BMW Manufacturing in the United States

For more than three decades, BMW Manufacturing has been a high-performance economic engine for South Carolina and the United States. The plant is the largest single BMW production facility in the world with more than 11,000 associates assembling six top-selling BMW X models and their variants. Last year, nearly 400,000 vehicles were assembled in the U.S.

Since 2014, the South Carolina plant has exported more than 2.7 million BMWs – about 63 percent of total production – with an export value of more than $104 billion, which has made BMW Manufacturing the leading automotive exporter by value from the United States over the past decade. Last year alone, the plant exported nearly 225,000 BMW Sports Activity Vehicles and Coupes with an export value of more than $10 billion.

The Spartanburg plant contributes billions to the local economy through job creation, investment, and production. The annual economic impact of Plant Spartanburg totals about $26.7 billion, according to a study released in 2023 by the Darla Moore School of Business at the University of South Carolina. The study also shows that Plant Spartanburg supports, both directly and indirectly, nearly 43,000 jobs across the state along with $3.1 billion in wages and salaries. The plant’s direct employment base also accounts for 4.8 percent of all manufacturing jobs across South Carolina.

The presence of BMW Manufacturing has also attracted a network of suppliers and related industries, further enhancing economic growth. Additionally, the facility's operations contribute to tax revenues that benefit local and state governments, supporting infrastructure and community services. Overall, BMW Manufacturing plays a crucial role in driving economic development in South Carolina.

According to the study, nearly half of Plant Spartanburg’s annual economic impact comes from the operations of its in-state supplier base. BMW regularly uses more than 500 South Carolina suppliers, 90 percent of which are in the Upstate. Having such a large in-state supplier base means BMW has a uniquely high employment multiplier of 3.5. That means for every 10 jobs created at Plant Spartanburg, another 25 are created elsewhere in the state, for a total of 35 jobs.

"Since establishing our presence in South Carolina more than 30 years ago, BMW has generated thousands of sustainable jobs, invested in our workforce through training, and supported educational, cultural, and civic initiatives throughout the state," stated Dr. Engelhorn. "Our achievements are a result of the commitment of our associates, the support of our supplier network, and the collaboration with state and local officials.”

Since 1992, the BMW Group has invested more than $14.8 billion in its South Carolina operations. Plant Spartanburg assembles more than 1,500 vehicles each day and up to 450,000 annually. The plant plays a critical role in meeting the high demand for BMW Sports Activity Vehicles and Coupes in the U.S. and around the world. Each year, around half of the BMW vehicles sold in the U.S. come from Plant Spartanburg. The model portfolio includes six top-selling BMW X models, four Motorsport X models, and two plug-in hybrid electric vehicle X models.

# BMW Motorrad presents the new BMW R 1300 RT.
## The new BMW R 1300 RT: The touring icon even more accessible and more dynamic than ever before, offering a wider range from comfortable tourer to dynamic country road motorcycle.
Date: 2025-04-29 | Author: Veronika Kluepfel BMW Group | ID: T0449765EN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“With the new BMW R 1300 RT, we’ve taken the touring icon from BMW Motorrrad to a whole new level. It is lighter in design, more accessible and more dynamic than ever before. In addition, with a completely new engine, chassis and aerodynamics, it offers a riding experience that meets the highest demands in this segment in terms of dynamics, comfort and travel capability". Harald Spagl, Project Manager BMW R 1300 RT

The new BMW R 1300 RT: Wider range from comfortable tourer to dynamic country road motorcycle. Dynamic design language with optimised wind and weather protection .

The new BMW R 1300 RT follows in the footsteps of its highly successful predecessor. It continues to build on the proven qualities of the BMW RT, such as touring capability and riding comfort - alone, as a pair or with plenty of luggage.

At the same time, the new R 1300 RT has broadened its usage profile by making its dynamic systems even more prominent. Sporty optional equipment such as the sport brake, the enhanced Shift Assistant Pro and the newly developed DCA electronic suspension allow an even more active and dynamic riding style. The range of optional extras is complemented by the Automated Shift Assistant ASA, which can be ridden in a sporty and dynamic manual mode, but also allows comfortable riding in automatic mode. All this, combined with a more dynamic and visually lighter design, promises to continue the success story of the BMW RT.

The wind and weather protection concept of the new R 1300 RT includes adjustable side trim that is homogeneously integrated into the design. This makes it possible to provide the rider with an adequate supply of fresh air at all times, even in challenging conditions such as city traffic or high outside temperatures on country roads, and to offer highly effective protection from the wind and weather at low temperatures when riding on the highway or motorway.

In addition to the basic version in Alpine [ADDRESS] uni colour, the new BMW R 1300 RT is available in the Triple Black model variant in Blackstorm metallic, the emphatically dynamic Impulse model variant in Racing Blue metallic and the particularly elegant model variant [ADDRESS] Camargue in Blue Ridge Mountain metallic.

Perfect ergonomics and equipment for comfortable and dynamic travelling and touring.

The BMW R 1300 RT's design, engine and chassis are not the only aspects of the BMW touring icon that reflect the BMW Motorrad development team's ambition to expand the range of possible uses of the new BMW R 1300 RT and make it even more dynamic. Equal importance was also placed on ergonomics, with a focus on creating a more active riding position.

Accordingly, the ergonomic triangle formed by handlebars, footrests and seat on the new R 1300 RT have been designed to position the rider noticeably further forward. This results in improved feedback from the front section and therefore even greater controllability during dynamic riding. At the same time, the more active seating position still allows for relaxed touring and cruising, even with a passenger. The height and angle of the rider's seat can be adjusted to fine-tune the riding position. Passenger comfort has also been significantly improved. The new cases now offer more space for the passenger’s lower legs without compromising the volume of the cases. The passenger seat has also been lengthened. There is now more space to change your seating position from time to time on longer trips.

A choice of different seat heights for optimum riding comfort and a new luggage system with electric cases and topcase. Additional variable-volume case system for optimum customisation.

As usual, BMW Motorrad's engineers have paid particular attention to easy access and a low seat height. For this reason, the development of the new R 1300 RT placed particular focus on achieving a seat height of only 780 mm. The inner leg curve is also significantly smaller than on the previous model. In addition to the standard seat, other seats are available as individual items of optional equipment ex works.

The new BMW R 1300 RT is equipped as standard with cases (27 litres each) for touring and holiday trips. Further highlights of the new R 1300 RT are the Vario cases, available ex works for the first time as an optional equipment for a BMW RT. The variable luggage system allows the volume to be adjusted from 27 to 33 litres to suit the width of the motorcycle. Both cases are electrified and can be unlocked using the central locking system. They also both feature interior lighting, and the left-hand case includes a USB-C charging port. The two topcases with a capacity of 39 and 54 litres respectively offer additional storage space. The large 54-litre luggage compartment is also electric. A special feature is the heated backrest for the passenger.

Rugged boxer engine with top figures for power output and torque along with optimised running smoothness and efficiency.

The boxer engine in the new BMW R 1300 RT has a capacity of exactly 1,300 cc while the ratio between bore and stroke is 106.5 to 73 mm (predecessor: 102.5 to 76 mm). This increase in capacity derives from an enlarged cylinder bore and a new crankshaft with reduced stroke. It has an output of 107 kW (145 hp) (predecessor: 100 kW (136 hp), still at 7,750 rpm, and develops a maximum torque of 149 Nm at 6 ,00 rpm (predecessor: 143 Nm at 6,250 rpm), making it by far the most powerful serial production BMW boxer engine to date. Its maximum engine speed is 9,000 rpm.

Three riding modes are included as standard, allowing the bike to adapt ideally to any road conditions. Riding Modes Pro with the additional modes “Dynamic” and “Dynamic Pro”, along with riding mode pre-selection as optional equipment ex works. Engine drag torque control (MSR) as standard .

In standard trim, the new R 1300 RT has three riding modes for adaptation to individual rider preferences. The “Rain” and “Road” riding modes allow riding characteristics to be adapted to most road conditions. The “Eco” riding mode also makes it possible to use the innovative BMW ShiftCam technology primarily in such a way that the maximum range can be achieved with a single tank of fuel. On request the new R 1300 RT can also be fitted with the optional equipment item “Riding Modes Pro” ex works: among other things, this comprises the additional riding modes “Dynamic” and “Dynamic Pro”. With the riding mode pre-selection the rider can use the riding mode button to make an individual selection. In this way, a preferred and easily manageable number of riding modes can be configured and selected while riding.

Engine drag torque control (MSR) is on board even in standard trim. This can be used to safely avoid unstable riding conditions that can occur during coasting or downshifting due to excessive brake slip at the rear wheel. In these cases, the engine drag control instantly opens the throttle valves to such an extent that drag torque is equalised and the motorcycle stabilises.

Automated Shift Assistant (ASA) with fully automated clutch operation and manual or automated shifting for an enhanced motorcycling experience as optional equipment.

With the Automated Shift Assistant (ASA), BMW Motorrad offers an innovative technical solution to make motorcycling easier and more comfortable. True to the motto “Simplify your Ride”, automated clutch operation and gear changes puts the riding experience even more front and centre - without sacrificing the dynamics of the shifting process.

Completely newly developed chassis with sheet metal main frame made of steel and aluminium rear fram e.

The chassis of the new BMW R 1300 RT has been completely redesigned. The centrepiece is the new sheet metal main frame made of steel, which in addition to a significant optimisation of the installation space for even more compact packaging also offers higher levels of stiffness than the predecessor model. In the course of the redesign, the rear frame was also completely reconceived. In place of the previous tubular steel construction, the new R 1300 RT now has an aluminium lattice tube rear frame.

In combination with a drive unit that is now much more compact, the new design of the chassis achieved a significant concentration of mass towards the overall centre of gravity, which is reflected in noticeable handling benefits. At the same time, the new R 1300 RT is even more precise and stable when braking, requires noticeably less effort to ride, and offers an even more satisfyingly precise response of the suspension elements.

The best of both worlds: EVO Telelever front wheel guide with flex element and new EVO Paralever rear wheel guide for even greater steering precision and ride stability. New wheels more than 1.4 kg lighter.

The front wheel guide in the new R 1300 RT follows the Telelever principle introduced by BMW [ADDRESS] years ago - but in an innovative, newly designed form that combines the best of both worlds.

With the Evo Telelever, BMW Motorrad now combines the strengths of the two previously used Telelever variants in the new BMW R 1300 RT. Clamped tightly to the fork tubes - as previously in the sporty design - the upper fork construction (as in the GS) incorporates a handlebar decoupling system that prevents any detrimental tilting movement and only transmits steering forces.

The rear wheel guide of the new R 1300 RT has also been redesigned. The hallmark of the Evo Paralever is a significantly stiffer connection via the suspension in the frame and a continuous swinging arm quick-release axle.

The new R 1300 RT features new 17-inch aluminium cast wheels with hollow-spoke design. All in all they weigh in at more than 1.4 kg less than the existing wheels.

New electronic suspension Dynamic Chassis Adaption (DCA) for two rider-selectable riding positions for maximum spread between ride comfort and dynamic handling as well as with dynamic adjustment of damping, spring rate and load equalisation as optional equipment ex works.

Even the standard Dynamic ESA electronic chassis offers a high level of riding safety and riding enjoyment on a wide variety of road surfaces thanks to dynamic adjustment of the damping and load-dependent adjustment of the rear spring preload.

The electronic Dynamic Chassis Adaption (DCA) now goes one step further and, in addition to the familiar Dynamic Suspension Adjustment (DSA) options - such as dynamic adjustment of damping, spring rate and load equalisation - offers two rider-selectable riding positions via the riding modes for maximum spread between ride comfort and dynamic handling. This makes for an even more thrilling riding experience in all conditions.

DCA has been developed with equal emphasis on dynamic performance and comfort. The new semi-active chassis offers two different riding positions. One riding position has a flat steering head angle and therefore a chassis geometry designed to maximise riding stability and smoothness. The second riding position features firmer damping tuning, a higher spring rate and a higher ride height. Raising the rear end more than the front results in a steeper steering head angle and reduced castor, making the motorcycle easier to steer and handle. DCA makes these two different chassis geometries possible and combines them with the riding modes.

A high-performance braking system in conjunction with Integral ABS Pro comes as standard. Sport brake as optional equipment ex works.

The R 1300 RT comes as standard with a twin disc brake featuring two radially mounted four-piston fixed callipers at the front and a single disc brake with two-piston floating calliper at the rear in conjunction with BMW Motorrad Integral ABS Pro. The new BMW R 1300 RT can be fitted with the sport brake system as optional equipment ex works. In addition to a sportier look with titanium-coloured brake callipers, it offers a slight increase in braking performance.

New full LED headlights and state-of-the-art LED light units feature all round. Headlight Pro with adaptive headlight and pitch compensation as well as adaptive light modes with intelligent adjustment of the alignment and intensity of the low beam to different riding situations are available as optional equipment ex works.

For decades now, BMW Motorrad has been regarded as a frontrunner when it comes to safety in connection with motorcycling. Accordingly, the new R 1300 RT comes with state-of-the-art LED light units all around as standard. The new full LED headlamp which illuminates the road with unrivalled brightness and clarity, underlines the prestige of the new R 1300 RT. The light unit consists of an LED module with multiple LEDs for low beam and high beam. The daytime running light or position light icon (depending on the market), which is positioned to the left and right of the headlamp, provides a distinctive look.

Headlight Pro goes one step further available as optional equipment ex works. In addition to the adaptive headlight, the headlamp of the new R 1300 RT also features pitch compensation - for example when accelerating and decelerating as well as for levelling the riding position in DCA. Headlight Pro features a servomotor that automatically and actively adjusts the position of the cut-off line to keep the vertical inclination within the optimum range when the load or load status changes.

Headlight Pro can be further enhanced with the optional “Adaptive Light Modes” (depending on market), which offer lighting technology that intelligently adapts the direction and intensity of the low beam to different riding situations. The Adaptive Lighting Modes provide optimum lighting conditions for night-time riding with speed-dependent road illumination. Lighting is provided in several stages: for low, medium and high speeds. Intelligent adaptation to speed and riding conditions increases safety and helps to guide the rider.

Riding Assistant with Active Cruise Control (ACC), Front Collision Warning (FCW), Lane Change Warning (SWW) and Rear End Collision Warning (RECW) for convenient and safe motorcycling as optional equipment ex works.

The new R 1300 RT is already equipped with Dynamic Cruise Control (DCC) with braking function as standard. The Riding Assistant offers many more functions as an optional extra ex works. It consists of Active Cruise Control (ACC), Front Collision Warning (FCW), Lane Change Warning (SWW) and Rear End Collision Warning (RECW).

10.25-inch TFT colour display with map navigation, a wide range of functions and new Connectivity Hub for controlling accessories as well as actively ventilated smartphone charging compartment with USB-C charging port as standard.

The R 1300 RT comes fitted as standard with a 10.25-inch TFT colour screen with integrated map navigation and newly developed Connectivity Hub. With maximum connectivity, excellent readability, clear menu navigation and a highly integrated operating concept, the new R 1300 RT maintains its leading position among production motorcycles.

The “tiles” shown can be used to select the “My Motorcycle”, “Radio”, “Navigation”, “Media”, “Phone” and “Settings” menus. A new feature is the Connectivity Hub "tile" for connecting current and future accessories such as smart glasses, heated vests and lightweight jackets. This simplifies the operation of the accessories.

The new R 1300 RT comes as standard with an actively ventilated smartphone charging compartment located within the rider's reach. It is even easier to open than its predecessor and can accommodate much larger smartphones. The smartphone battery is charged via a USB-C interface. The lid also has a clip that can be used for a debit card or banknotes.

Audio System and Audio Pro available as optional extras ex-works for outstanding sound.

With the Audio System, the new R 1300 RT offers an even more intense sound experience. It features a high level of integration with the vehicle's electrical system. The menu control, setting options and unique display concept make the audio experience perfect in terms of interaction as well. In addition to the loudspeakers, a connected communication system can also be used for playback.

Audio Pro offers an even more impressive sound experience. Ordered as optional equipment to the audio system, it features higher quality loudspeakers with separate tweeter/midrange and woofer control for extra powerful, crystal-clear sound. A choice of sound profiles and dynamic volume control ensure optimum listening pleasure in every riding situation. Audio Pro is also a visual highlight. A silver perforated grille without fleece provides a clear view of the speakers with their gold dust protection dome.

Optional equipment and Original BMW Motorrad Accessories for the new BMW R 1300 RT.

An extensive programme of optional equipment and optional accessories is available for further customisation of the new BMW R 1300 RT.

# BMW Group launches demo fleet for diesel replacement fuels
## +++ BMW Group demands: HVO100-only vehicles to be included in fleet legislation +++ Proof of alternative fuels in demo fleet now possible +++ Since 2025: BMW diesel ex-works with HVO100 +++
Date: 2025-10-22 | Author: Bernhard Ederer BMW Group | ID: T0453479EN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Luxembourg / Munich. The BMW Group is using its presence at the "Fleet Europe Days" on 22 and 23 October in Luxembourg to show fleet operators ways to decarbonise their fleets. In addition to fully electrified vehicles, the focus will be on fuels based on renewable raw materials, so-called Carbon Neutral Fuels (CNF).

Their advantage: the potential to save CO 2 . With more than 250 million existing vehicles in Europe, their CO 2 footprint can be improved if the proportion of renewable fuels is increased. A new technical solution used by the BMW Group is proof that all BMW diesels in a fleet are fuelled exclusively with HVO100. Refuelling data from the vehicle is compared with data from the fleet operator's payment system. This means that the fuel used by the vehicle can be traced seamlessly. An important step towards a "CNF only-fleet" for fleet customers. Dr. Martin Kaufmann, Head of Powertrain Development at the BMW Group: "Our goal is always to have more environmentally friendly and efficient vehicles on the road. With the diesel replacement fuel HVO100, we have an opportunity to reduce the CO 2 footprint of vehicle fleets. Especially in the area of fuels that are not based on fossil fuels, we see a potential that we are ready to realise.”

Bernhard Kuhnt, Head of Sales Region Europe, BMW Group: "Fleet customers are extremely important for sales in Europe and at the same time diesel remains a very good powertrain technology for many fleets.

The use of HVO100 offers a way to quickly reduce CO 2 emissions that takes into account individual use cases - whether driving long distances or towing a trailer - and can thus help our fleet customers reduce their CO 2 footprint."

Initial contractual agreements with the operators of large BMW diesel fleets in Germany and Italy are imminent. These test fleets, together with the internal BMW Group fleet that has already been launched, will provide important data and findings for the further improvement of the technical solution. HVO100 used in the first fuelling of all diesel produced in Germany

Since January 2025, all diesel models produced in Germany are being fuelled with HVO100 before delivery to dealers. This step underlines BMW's commitment to making decarbonisation possible and achievable today. The abbreviation HVO stands for 'Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil' and the suffix '100' indicates that it is filled with 100 per cent pure fuel.

"Neste MY Renewable Diesel™" HVO100 is used at the BMW Group plants in Munich, Dingolfing, Regensburg and Leipzig.

The fuel from Finnish manufacturer Neste enables a CO2e reduction of up to 90 per cent ("well to wheel") compared to fossil diesel. The initial filling at the plants before delivery to the BMW Group dealer organisation is five to eight litres, depending on the model.

The BMW Group has long approved its vehicles for a variety of regenerative fuels: HVO according to EN15940 as well as B10 and eFuels according to EN590 for diesel engines. In addition, E20/25 and eFuels according to EN228 for petrol engines. Regulatory framework conditions must catch up

Regulation must catch up. To accelerate the uptake of renewable fuels across the market, the BMW Group is calling for an ambitious implementation of the Renewable Energy Directive (RED III), including national quotas that require at least a 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from fuels, to be transposed into national law by 2025. Dr. Thomas Becker, Head of Policy, External Relations and Sustainability at the BMW Group, says: "The BMW Group demands that every measure to reduce CO 2 emissions is taken into account at every stage of a vehicle's life cycle. This also includes the use of renewable fuels - especially for vehicles that primarily run on CO 2 -neutral fuel (CNF). These must be formally recognised in EU fleet legislation. The fuels are available, what we need now is a pragmatic and quickly implementable regulation that enables companies to develop innovations and make them marketable."

+++ Final entry list published +++ ‘Bryan Bros’ (USA) and U.S. Amateur Champion José Luis Ballester (ESP) to make their debut at the BMW International Open +++ National amateur spots for Tim Wiedemeyer (GC St. Leon-Rot) and Wolfgang Glawe (GC Hubbelrath) +++ Media Service: Key facts & figures at a glance +++

Munich. The player field for the 36th BMW International Open (2-6 July 2025, GC München Eichenried) is complete. Among the 156 participants, new additions include the American brothers Wesley and George Bryan, as well as Spain’s José Luis Ballester, each of whom received a wild card from tournament organiser BMW. The ‘Bryan Bros’ have built a large fan base as content creators but will approach their debut on the DP World Tour with a clear sporting focus and ambitious goals. Wesley Bryan proved his potential in 2017 when he won the RBC Heritage on the PGA TOUR.

Ballester is the reigning U.S. Amateur Champion, a victory that placed him in an illustrious group. Golf legends such as Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson (both USA), Viktor Hovland (NOR), and Matt Fitzpatrick (ENG) also launched impressive careers with that title. This year, the 21-year-old has already competed at the Masters and the U.S. Open and is now looking forward to his first appearance on the DP World Tour.

Anticipation for the BMW International Open is also high for Tim Wiedemeyer (GC St. Leon-Rot) and Wolfgang Glawe (GC Hubbelrath), who secured the two spots reserved for German amateurs. For Munich-born Wiedemeyer, Germany’s only DP World Tour event also marks a return to his hometown.

# BMW Group sets new climate target for 2035: At least 60 million tons of CO2e savings compared to 2019 – another milestone on the road to net zero
## +++ New milestone on the road to net zero by 2050 +++ Comprehensive decarbonization across the entire life cycle and all drive variants +++
Date: 2025-12-02 | Author: Isabel Richter BMW Group | ID: T0454269EN_GB
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: This press release is a 1:1 copy of the original issued by BMW headquarters in Germany. No adaptions have been made to cater to the UK market. Munich, 2 December 2025. The BMW Group has defined a new 2035 milestone for cutting CO 2 e emissions on the road to net zero. The company aims to reduce its CO 2 e emissions by at least 60 million metric tons compared to 2019 levels, an additional reduction of approximately 20 million tons of CO 2 e beyond the existing 2030 target. In doing so, the BMW Group is pursuing a comprehensive decarbonization strategy along the entire life cycle, with the goal of achieving net zero by 2050 at the latest. This represents a firm commitment to the goals set out in the Paris Agreement. To date, the target has been to cut at least 40 million metric tons of CO 2 e across the entire life cycle (scopes 1, 2 and 3) by 2030 compared to 2019 levels. The new 2035 milestone is a logical next step on this road toward advancing decarbonization. At the same time, the climate impact of the BMW Group’s business model will also be drastically reduced. By 2035, each euro generated will see less than half as much CO 2 e emitted compared to 2019. The key measures for achieving these results include the increasing use of renewable energies in production and the supply chain, the increased utilization of secondary raw materials, efficiency improvements in the use phase, as well as product and process innovations. The latter are being implemented across all drive variants as part of the BMW Group’s technology-neutral approach. In addition, an increasing proportion of the vehicle fleet will continue to be electrified.

# BMW ART MAKERS: Les Rencontres d’Arles and BMW France celebrate 15 years of long-term partnership dedicated to contemporary creation and the visual arts.
## +++ [ADDRESS] years, BMW France has been official partner of Les Rencontres d’Arles, actively contributing to its international influence and supporting artistic creativity +++ Each year, BMW presents a unique exhibition developed by an artist-curator duo selected through the BMW ART MAKERS programme +++ During the festival, BMW also provides a fully electric VIP car service for curators, artists, and guests +++

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Munich/Arles. The 2025 edition of Les Rencontres d’Arles promises to be particularly special. It features the unprecedented exhibition "Traversée du fragment manquant" by artist Raphaëlle Peria and curator Fanny Robin , the winning duo of the BMW ART MAKERS programme. This milestone also marks the 15th anniversary of a long-standing cultural partnership between BMW France and Les Rencontres d’Arles.

Les Rencontres d’Arles 2025. "Trees are living beings that carry our memory; they are the guardians of our secrets," says artist Raphaëlle Peria .

The exhibition "Traversée du fragment manquant" by Raphaëlle Peria and Fanny Robin, winners of the BMW ART MAKERS 2025 programme, will premiere this summer during the 56th edition of Les Rencontres d’Arles at the Cloître Saint-Trophime.

"With ‘Traversée du fragment manquant’, Raphaëlle Peria presents a new body of work based on fresh research and new artistic processes. Revisiting childhood photographs from her first journey along the Canal du Midi, she retraces the path of the plane trees now threatened by a devastating fungus. By exploring this landscape of memory through new effects of transparency, she captures the evolution of a disappearing nature – inscribing absence and the passage of time into her images," says the curator Fanny Robin .

Raphaëlle Peria and Fanny Robin declare, "This award recognizes our longstanding creative partnership and allows us to go further in our exploration of new materials and forms. We aim for this project to be both unique and bold, made possible thanks to the dedicated support of the BMW team. With ‘Traversée du fragment manquant’, we invite viewers to take part in a poetic journey through the heart of photographic imagery."

The BMW ART MAKERSprogramme brings together and supports an emerging visual artist and curator in the joint creation of an original artistic project. The winning duo receives a €33,000 grant as well as production and research funding. The resulting exhibition is first presented at Les Rencontres d’Arles and then showcased at Paris Photo, where BMW is also an official partner.

Practical Information Exhibition: "Traversée du fragment manquant" by Raphaëlle Peria and Fanny Robin. Location: Robin Cloître Saint-Trophime, Arles. Dates: 7 July – 5 October 2025.

A celebration of diversity and long-term commitment: 15 years of partnership.

As this anniversary approaches, BMW France reflects on a long-standing collaboration. As a pioneering company, BMW values the avant-garde visions of artists, who foresee the world’s future challenges. Their unique perspectives help us anticipate social transformations and enrich our understanding of the world.

[ADDRESS] years, BMW has provided a platform for artistic experimentation through its partnership with the festival. The diversity of projects presented over the years highlights the evolution of contemporary creation and reinforces BMW's role as a committed supporter of emerging talents.

From ten years of the BMW Residency to the last three editions of the BMW ART MAKERS programme, numerous artists and curators have explored contemporary themes through varied and innovative practices. Artists such as Alexandra Catière, Baptiste Rabichon, and Almudena Romero have combined traditional techniques with new technologies to create sensitive, imaginative, and sometimes ephemeral works. Other projects have explored intersections between disciplines – like Natasha Caruana's exploration of love and science, or the immersive installation by Arash Hanaei and Morad Montazami examining the impact of digital technologies on human subjectivity.

Humour infused the examination of human-animal relationships in the work of Mazaccio & Drowilal, while Alinka Echeverria challenged traditional representations of femininity and identity. Emeric Lhuisset addressed physical and cultural borders, while Marion Gronier revealed the world of the circus through portraiture. Dune Varela questioned the permanence and two-dimensionality of photography, while Eva Nielsen and Marianne Derrien reinvented the medium through solar screen printing to evoke the layered nature of landscapes . Mustapha Azeroual and Marjolaine Levy’s use of lenticular panoptics in "The Green Ray" revealed what often escapes our gaze.

Through this collaboration with Les Rencontres d’Arles, BMW France contributes to the photographic heritage while nurturing the diversity of contemporary expression and encouraging critical engagement with the present. This approach fosters a shared narrative and redefines our perception of the modern world.

A strong commitment to education and transmission. Beyond creativity, this partnership is also rooted in education, particularly through “La Rentrée en Images”, an initiative by Les Rencontres d’Arles. Each year, more than 400 school classes are invited to discover contemporary photography, develop critical thinking skills, and reflect on their relationship with images.

A shared vision for the future of culture. BMW is committed to supporting artistic creation, research, and cultural transmission in a spirit of sustainability and social responsibility. BMW’s partnerships are part of a long-term strategy aimed at making culture accessible to all while fostering dialogue between artists, society, and the company. This anniversary highlights the strength and longevity of BMW’s relationship with Les Rencontres d’Arles and reflects a shared vision.

"The partnership with BMW fully aligns with the mission of Les Rencontres d'Arles to support emerging creation and offer a platform for exploring contemporary issues in an experimental context. The launch of the BMW ART MAKERS programme four years ago marked a significant turning point by offering a selected artist-curator duo the means to bring their exhibition project to life. Over the past 15 years of collaboration, BMW has helped foster the emergence of new talent. This year, the project ‘Traversée du fragment manquant’ by Raphaëlle Peria and Fanny Robin – winners of the BMW ART MAKERS programme – is presented as part of the ‘Nomadic Chronicles’ section of Les Rencontres d’Arles 2025. It explores the traces left by the transformation of the landscape along the Canal du Midi. Merging photography, engraving, and memory, family archives blend with tactile gestures in a sensitive rediscovery of the territory," says Christoph Wiesner, Director of Les Rencontres d’Arles.

"Together, we make culture shine – today and for future generations – celebrating the value of long-term commitment in a rapidly changing world," says Vincent Salimon, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW Group France .

# The first-ever BMW M3 CS Touring: Racing DNA meets maximised everyday usability.
## With the first-ever BMW M3 CS Touring (fuel consumption combined: 10.5 l/100 km [26.9 mpg imp]; CO2 emissions combined: 238 g/km in the WLTP cycle, CO2 class: G), BMW M GmbH is adding another special-edition model to its line-up in the high-performance sports car segment. The latest new addition to the manufacturer’s most popular range builds on the success of the BMW M3 Competition Touring with M xDrive (fuel consumption combined: 10.4 l/100 km [27.2 mpg imp]; CO2 emissions combined: 235 g/km in the WLTP cycle, CO2 class: G) and blends that car’s very distinctive character profile with even greater potential for emotionally exhilarating performance. A 405 kW/550 hp six-cylinder in-line engine, bespoke chassis tuning, exclusive design features and weight savings resulting from the use of numerous carbon fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP) components provide the ingredients for an unadulterated racing-car feeling. The on-board space of the first-ever BMW M3 CS Touring can be used in a wide variety of ways, which ensures that its ultra-dynamic driving characteristics can be experienced both on the race track and in myriad everyday situations, during leisure activities and on trips away.
Date: 2025-01-30 | Author: Christian Pomp BMW Group | ID: T0447610EN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The model-specific performance characteristics of the engine and power transfer via the eight-speed M Steptronic transmission and M xDrive all-wheel-drive system serve up dynamic thrills and supreme traction. The BMW M3 CS Touring races from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 3.5 seconds.

The world premiere of the first-ever BMW M3 CS Touring will be hosted by the Mount Panorama Circuit in Bathurst, in the Australian state of New South Wales. The BMW M3 CS Touring will be revealed to the public for the first time on 30 January 2025 as part of the [ADDRESS] Hour race programme. Deliveries of the limited-run model to customers in Europe, Australia, Japan and South Korea, among others, will begin in March 2025. The car’s home market of Germany is by a distance its most important sales region. The special edition will be produced alongside all other variants of the BMW M3 Sedan and BMW M3 Touring at BMW Group Plant Munich.

Six-cylinder in-line engine adapts racing-car technology.

[ADDRESS].0-litre six-cylinder in-line engine in the BMW M3 CS Touring was designed from the outset to deliver high performance on the race track – and it features a multitude of technological details from racing-car design. These include an extremely rigid crankcase with a sleeve-free, closed-deck construction, a forged lightweight crankshaft and a cylinder head with a 3D-printed core. The likewise weight-saving cylinder bores have a wire-arc sprayed iron coating to reduce frictional losses. The cooling system and oil supply are also designed to handle the sustained heavy loads generated during hard driving on a track.

The drive unit combines the high-revving characteristics for which M is renowned and linear power delivery into the upper reaches of the engine’s range with upgraded M TwinTurbo technology. Raising the maximum charge pressure of the two mono-scroll turbochargers to 2.1 bar and making model-specific tweaks to the engine management enable the maximum output of the BMW M3 Competition Touring with M xDrive to be increased by another 15 kW/20 hp to 405 kW/550 hp. The engine develops its peak torque of 650 Nm (479 lb-ft) between just 2,750 and 5,950 rpm, produces its maximum output at 6,250 rpm and tops out at 7,200 rpm.

In addition, a specially designed engine mounting with increased spring rates creates an extremely rigid connection between the power unit and the vehicle’s structure. This leads to even sharper engine response and extremely direct transmission of its power to the drivetrain. Its instantaneous power delivery means the BMW M3 CS Touring can power from rest to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 3.5 seconds, and 0 to 200 km/h (124 mph) is over in 11.7 seconds. The figures recorded using the “one-foot rollout” method* are 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 3.2 seconds and 0 to 200 km/h (124 mph) in 11.4 seconds. The mid-range sprint from 80 to 120 km/h (50 – 75 mph) takes 2.7 seconds in 4th gear and 3.5 seconds in 5th gear. The top speed of the special-edition model – which comes as standard with the M Driver’s Package – is electronically limited to 300 km/h (186 mph).

The car’s emotionally stirring engine note is the work of the M-specific exhaust system featuring electrically controlled flaps, a titanium rear silencer with weight-minimising design and – in customary M fashion – two pairs of tailpipes painted in matt Black. The engine’s acoustic presence varies according to the engine profile the driver selects from the M Setup menu. SPORT or SPORT+ mode produces a drive sound that injects real aural drama into proceedings, particularly through gear changes and the accompanying adjustments in rev speed.

Eight-speed M Steptronic transmission, M xDrive and Active M Differential enable irresistibly dynamic power transfer.

The engine under the bonnet of the BMW M3 CS Touring teams up with an eight-speed M Steptronic transmission including Drivelogic. The Drivelogic button integrated into the gear selector lever makes it possible to alter the transmission’s shift characteristics, with a choice of three clearly distinguishable settings available. As well as comfort-focused and sporty options, drivers can also engage a setting optimised specially for track driving. Both the selector lever and the carbon-fibre shift paddles on the steering wheel enable sequential interventions in the gear selection process.

The BMW M3 CS Touring channels its power to the road through the M xDrive all-wheel-drive system. This employs an electronically controlled multi-plate clutch in the transfer case to ensure fully variable and super-smooth distribution of the engine’s power between the front and rear wheels, and serves up tireless all-wheel-drive performance, even during hard track sessions. In tandem with the Active M Differential at the rear axle – whose operation is also fully variable – the intelligent all-wheel-drive system’s rear-wheel bias enhances the M-typical handling dynamics. Added to which, 4WD Sport mode can be selected via the M Setup menu. This sends an even greater proportion of the engine’s power to the rear wheels. 2WD mode, meanwhile, delivers a driving experience for the ultimate purist, laying on classical rear-wheel drive with the DSC (Dynamic Stability Control) system deactivated.

Model-specific tuning for the chassis technology and performance-focused stopping power.

The chassis technology in the BMW M3 CS Touring has been tuned precisely to the engine’s performance characteristics, the overall vehicle concept and the specific weight distribution of this latest special-edition model. The settings for the DSC system and M Dynamic Mode have also been purposefully optimised for the specific demands of dynamically committed circuit driving. The electronically controlled dampers of the adaptive M suspension on the BMW M3 CS Touring likewise come in a model-specific setup, as do its M Servotronic steering and integrated braking system.

Providing outstanding stopping power are M Compound brakes with callipers painted in a choice of Red or Black. There is also the option of M Carbon ceramic brakes whose brake callipers are available in Red or matt Gold. Also on the standard equipment list are forged M light-alloy wheels in an exclusive double-spoke design with a matt Gold Bronze or matt Black finish. [ADDRESS] inches in diameter at the front axle and 20 inches at the rear, the wheels are fitted as standard with track tyres (275/35 ZR19 at the front, 285/30 ZR20 at the rear). As an alternative to these tyres, customers also have the no-cost option of sport tyres with the same dimensions. And ultra-track tyres are also included on the options list.

Exclusive carbon-fibre components and optimised body rigidity help to produce outstanding performance attributes.

Together with the extremely powerful engine and model-specific chassis technology, intelligent lightweight design measures also play a major part in moulding the exclusive performance attributes of the BMW M3 CS Touring. Extensive use of carbon fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP) is particularly important when it comes to weight minimisation. The car’s bonnet, front splitter, front air intakes, exterior mirror caps and rear diffuser are all made from CFRP.

Inside the cabin, the M Carbon bucket seats and likewise CFRP steering wheel shift paddles, interior trim strips and centre console also do their bit to keep weight down. The various lightweight design measures bring about a total weight saving of some 15 kilograms over the BMW M3 Competition Touring with M xDrive. Body rigidity is further increased by specifying the optional M front end strut brace for the engine compartment that has also been engineered for lightness.

Exquisite balance of performance and everyday usability; exclusive design features.

Hallmark M performance and the versatility-focused body concept of a Touring model certainly make an unusual combination, and the latest special edition adds a special allure to the mix. In the BMW M3 CS Touring, a concentrated dose of M feeling meets a variable-usage interior whose storage capacity below the high-opening tailgate can be expanded from 500 litres to a maximum 1,510 litres. In addition, the dynamically stretched lines of the Touring model and the M-specific exterior details – crafted precisely to meet the technical demands of cooling air supply and aerodynamic balance – are complemented by exclusive design features whose striking appearance reflects the track-leaning instincts of the BMW M3 CS Touring.

For example, the standard-specification exposed carbon fibre of the special-edition’s bonnet, front splitter, front air intakes and M exterior mirror caps creates an eye-catching contrast against the visually striking exterior colours available for the rest of the car. The BMW M3 CS Touring can be ordered with a paint finish in British Racing Green, Laguna Seca Blue, Frozen Solid White or Sapphire Black metallic. The roof and model-specific roof spoiler are in Black high-gloss and bring an impression of elegance to the bold exterior. Another exclusive design feature of the special-edition model is the red surround for the roof spoiler.

The front end of the car is defined by the weight-minimised, ultra-stripped-back and frameless BMW M kidney grille. The black model lettering on the upper of the two horizontal grille slats is bordered by a red contour line, likewise the model badging at the front and rear. In a clear reference to motor sport, the LED headlights of the BMW M3 CS Touring glow with the same distinctive yellow light as GT racing cars.

Driver-focused cockpit with exclusive racing-car aura.

The interior of the BMW M3 CS Touring blends a sports-car cockpit designed to exude maximum performance with digital technology and exclusive design features. Electrically adjustable and heated M Carbon bucket seats are fitted as standard for the driver and front passenger. They have integral head restraints, an illuminated “CS” model badge and surfaces in Merino leather. Their exclusive Black/Red design is also adopted by the rear seats, while all the door panel trim is covered with black leather.

The standard M Alcantara steering wheel in three-spoke design – with its flat-bottomed rim and red centre marker in the 12-o’clock position – brings authentic racing car flair into the cockpit,. Further M-specific details are the red “CS” badge on the centre console, M seat belts and door sill plates with model lettering.

The M-specific Setup button on the centre console enables direct access to the settings for the engine, chassis, steering, brakes and M xDrive. Two individually configurable setup variants can be stored together with personal settings for the engine sound, DSC, Automatic Start/Stop function and the shift characteristics of the eight-speed M Steptronic transmission – and these setups are then selected using the M buttons on the steering wheel. The BMW M3 CS Touring also comes as standard with the M Drive Professional system with track-optimised functions such as the M Drift Analyser and M Laptimer. Added to which, the 10-stage M Traction Control delivers personalised driving fun on the track. Another feature of M Drive Professional is the M Mode button on the centre console, which can be used to configure the driver assistance systems and the content shown on the information display and Head-Up Display. Drivers can choose between ROAD, SPORT and TRACK settings here.

In the new BMW M3 CS Touring, the latest version of the display and control/operation system BMW iDrive based on BMW Operating [ADDRESS].5 provides intuitive control of numerous vehicle functions and digital services. With the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant and BMW Curved Display both on board, the car is based squarely on operation using touch control and natural language. The M-specific view on the 12.3-inch information display shows the familiar M Shift Lights at its upper edge, while the status of the driving stability systems, M xDrive and traction control can be found at the lower edge of the screen. The home screen of the 14.9-inch control display includes widgets for the vehicle setup, tire pressure and temperature.

Sophisticated options for enhancing driving pleasure and comfort in everyday use.

Standard specification for the BMW M3 CS Touring also includes BMW Live Cockpit Professional which, alongside the BMW Head-Up Display with M-specific content, brings the cloud-based navigation system BMW Maps, smartphone integration, telephony with wireless charging and a WiFi interface. The BMW Drive Recorder can be added as an option.

The BMW M3 CS Touring additionally offers customers a selection of comfort-enhancing features and driver assistance systems composed with the focus firmly on the enjoyment of unadulterated driving pleasure. Comfort Access, the alarm system, two-zone automatic climate control and the Harman Kardon Surround Sound System are all fitted as standard. Park Distance Control and the Parking Assistant, Front Collision Warning, Lane Departure Warning and the Speed Limit Info system are likewise standard, while the Driving Assistant system can be specified as an option.

* Value with “rollout” subtracted. With this alternative measuring method, time measurement only begins after leaving a light barrier. The distance not taken into account in the measurement (the “rollout”) is 1 foot = 30.48 cm. All figures relating to performance, fuel consumption, emissions and range are provisional.

# Endurance test for “Heart of Joy”: the BMW Vision Driving Experience.
## +++ Top-class dynamics, precision, efficiency and driving pleasure +++ New “Heart of Joy” central computer works ten times faster +++ Extending the recuperation range increases efficiency by 25% +++
Date: 2025-02-17 | Author: Dieter Falkensteiner BMW Group | ID: T0447831EN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Spartanburg / Munich. Showcasing driving pleasure up to the physical limits is the BMW Group’s mission with its new high-performance test vehicle – the #BMW Vision Driving Experience . This Vision Vehicle is not destined for series production, but is instead serving as a rolling test rig for drivetrain and driving dynamics management technology developed specially for the Neue Klasse – the next generation of BMW vehicles – and referred to by BMW as the #Heart of Joy . The prototype car put the capabilities of the Heart of Joy to the ultimate test of endurance at the BMW Performance Driving Center in Spartanburg, USA. And the company provided exclusive insights into its development programme for the electric driving experience on board the Neue Klasse as part of a preview presentation. Every fully electric Neue Klasse model will benefit from the Heart of Joy. The first taller Neue Klasse electric model will go into series production later this year at Plant Debrecen in Hungary. The new Heart of Joy adds a fourth dimension – BMW’s hallmark Sheer Driving Pleasure – to the existing trio of Neue Klasse characteristics (electrical, digital, circular). [EXECUTIVE_OFFICER], Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG, took to the stage at the IAA 2023 show holding the small black box. It is important to note that the control unit will go into series production, but the Vision Vehicle will not.

“The Heart of Joy enables us to take driving pleasure not just to the next level, but another one beyond that,” says Frank Weber, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, responsible for Development. “In addition, we are further increasing efficiency, and therefore boosting range, as in future the driver will brake almost exclusively using energy regeneration. This is Efficient Dynamics squared.”

The Heart of Joy control unit for the drivetrain, brakes, charging, recuperation and steering subfunctions processes information ten times faster than previous systems. Working in tandem with the BMW Dynamic Performance Control software, the Heart of Joy computes all the driving dynamics functions with a whole new level of speed and precision. The software has been developed entirely in-house on the back of experience in the field of driving dynamics amassed by BMW engineers over more than a century. The Vision Vehicle develops 18,000 Newton metres (13,269 lb-ft) of torque. The reasoning behind this is that if the control system can deal with an explosion of power of this magnitude, it will be able to handle the demands of everyday driving with ease.

Energy recovery under braking (also known as recuperation) sees the drivetrain and braking functions of electric vehicles forming a symbiosis. In the innovative electronics architecture of the Neue Klasse, the Heart of Joy is one of four central control units and combines drivetrain and driving dynamics functions for the first time. These innovative control functions are protected by several patent applications. The high-performance unit controls acceleration and braking, vehicle stabilisation, dynamic steering functions and charging management. The central processing unit and perfectly coordinated BMW Dynamic Performance Control software developed in-house enable all connected actuators to respond directly and with minimal delay: latencies are in the millisecond range. By contrast, conventional systems have separate control algorithms for the drive system and brakes. This means the full handling potential of vehicles with powerful electric drive systems cannot be fully exploited.

The driver and passengers here experience a harmonious and noiseless driving feeling – regardless of the situation and speed they are travelling at. In dynamic driving scenarios, the new Heart of Joy / BMW Dynamic Performance Control combination serves up cornering poise and assurance beyond compare. The car generates impressive traction and can be threaded through corners with exceptional precision. Fewer control inputs are required and the car’s line can be maintained with greater precision and stability. This helps the car to develop consistent, reproducible cornering behaviour and allows it to be steered more intuitively and smoothly. At low speeds – such as in stop-start driving or when parking – direct signal transmissions and rapid information processing ensure an even more compelling driving experience. In driving modes D or B, or when using Active Cruise Control, the parking brake or parking lock, stopping and restarting merge seamlessly into one another.

Furthermore, integrated drivetrain, braking and energy recuperation control allows energy to be used more sustainably. 98 per cent of drivers do not need to make any inputs using the conventional brakes. The braking power generated using energy recuperation is sufficient for normal, everyday driving. Only under heavy braking, e.g. in an emergency situation, is intervention required from the friction brakes. All in all, this system increases efficiency by up to 25 per cent.

The BMW Vision Driving Experience test vehicle demonstrates how the Heart of Joy works using illuminating colour codes on the wheel rims: acceleration is indicated in green, energy recuperation in blue and braking using the friction brakes in orange.

Four totally new super-brains will go to work in the BMW of the future. These high-performance computers cleverly combine various elements that previously ran separately. The Heart of Joy was developed 100 percent within the company. It allows four important control units to be brought together within a single high-performance computer.

Another three super-brains are responsible for features including automated and highly automated driving, infotainment and basic functions such as climate control and comfort-enhancing systems, vehicle access, interior and exterior lighting.

The BMW Vision Driving Experience will celebrate its official world premiere at #Auto Shanghai 2025.

BMW is spotlighting six digital features in its global innovation campaign. With its mixture of high-tech and humour, the campaign shows how these technologies make drivers’ everyday lives significantly more comfortable as well as safer. So far, BMW has published entertaining short videos about the BMW Digital Key/ BMW Digital Key Plus on the Apple Watch, the Motorway Assistant, Remote Control Parking and BMW Curve-Ahead View. Two further films are due to follow – all of them featuring unusual situations unlikely to be covered by any manual. Munich. Over the course of six creative social media films, BMW demonstrates how modern technology takes the driving experience to a new level. The BMW innovation campaign underscores the brand’s premium appeal – and features the tongue-in-cheek humour that has become a BMW hallmark. The films tell short stories in which digital features are not only helpers, but sometimes even become friendly accomplices. Also in starring roles: the BMW i5, BMW iX, BMW X1, BMW X3 and BMW X5, representing the wide range of digital features offered by many BMW model series.

“The BMW innovation campaign is about our promise to combine technology and driving pleasure in a unique way. We use humour to show how our digital features don’t just assist drivers but become faithful companions in everyday life,” says Bernd Körber, Senior Vice President BMW Brand and Product Management.

Benefits of advanced technology, explained in a charming and entertaining way. The BMW Digital Key or BMW Digital Key Plus replaces the physical vehicle key. The feature also enables owners to use an Apple Watch to unlock, start and lock their vehicle. This is a major plot element in the short film called “Tight”. The protagonist really does not have room for a vehicle key in his tight trousers, so he uses his Apple Watch in order to start his BMW X3 for a night out. Intelligent technology ensures that the size of his pockets does not limit his freedom.

The motorway assistant offers automated driving at [ADDRESS]+ and is a highlight in the range of BMW driver assistance systems. On motorways and dual carriageways, it provides active steering assistance at speeds of up to 130 km/h. A particularly innovative feature is the Active Lane Change Assistant with eye activation, available in selected markets. Drivers always remain responsible, but they are able to take their hands off the wheel at certain times. This comes in very handy indeed in the short film titled “Mustache”. Sitting at the wheel of his BMW i5, the driver uses the motorway assistant so he can twirl the ends of his mustache into shape with his fingertips and put on his sunglasses, for maximum cool factor.

The campaign’s “Top Dog” film features a deliveryman who comes across an unbelievable scene: a dog sitting at the wheel of a BMW X5 smoothly steers the vehicle backwards out of a garage, a look of intense concentration on its face. But this feat is actually the result of human and artificial intelligence: the owner is controlling the car from outside via her smartphone – using the My BMW app’s Remote Control Parking function. This enables the driver to perform precise parking manoeuvres from outside the vehicle, so tight garages or narrow parking spaces are no longer a problem. The amazing scene is in fact another example of intelligent BMW technology making everyday life easier.

Small break, great fun. In-car gaming can lead to surprising results – as the BMW innovation campaign shows in the short film titled “Race”. A businessman is enjoying a relaxed break while recharging the battery of his BMW i5 when the driver of a muscle car suddenly appears and challenges him to a race. However, the contest does not take place on the road, but in virtual reality, on the BMW Curved Display in the BMW i5 – using smartphones as controllers. What follows is an unusual showdown in a casual game. In the end, the rival’s stylish sunglasses go to the driver of the BMW i5, as a victory trophy. But the in-car gaming feature is a lot of fun, even when there are no strangers issuing challenges. In multiplayer mode, up to four people can play at the same time. The BMW Group partners with the AirConsole gaming platform for its in-car gaming support.

Digital solutions – in the right place and at the right time. Sometimes it’s good to know what lies ahead, even if you can’t see it yet. That’s exactly what the BMW Curve-Ahead View in the BMW X1 is designed for: it recognises upcoming bends and highlights them in colour on the BMW Head-Up Display. In addition, the driver receives real-time feedback on their current speed – both before and during a bend. This makes for a better sense of control while also increasing safety and driving comfort.

The film “Fish” provides a charming demonstration of how useful this can be in practice: a BMW X1 is carrying moving boxes – and in the middle of it all is a goldfish in a transport bag, on its way to a new home. A winding road lies ahead, and right next to the vulnerable passenger is a box full of bristling cactus spines ... BMW Curve-Ahead View is available for all BMW models equipped with Operating [ADDRESS] and BMW Digital Premium.

Understands every word: intelligent BMW technology. The BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant is the digital point of contact in all new BMW models. It understands natural language, answers questions, explains vehicle functions and – depending on the situation – can become a humorous companion or even a co-conspirator. As in the film “Bye, Honey”, in which the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant aids and abets a mom driving a BMW iX. She tries in vain to engage her daughter in a conversation. Even a dramatic countdown – “5, 4 ...” – with the tongue-in-cheek request to activate the ejector seat elicits no response. Only when the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant matter-of-factly continues “3, 2, 1 ...” does the daughter suddenly prick up her ears and turn to her mother, alarmed. The mystery is quickly solved. “It was just a joke,” the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant explains – and immediately adds a suitable route recommendation to the nearest burger restaurant.

The BMW innovation campaign was launched on 26 May. Click here to see the films published to date. In case of queries, please contact:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In its first decade, BMW of North America experienced tremendous growth. Sales doubled within the new company’s first five years, thanks in large part to the popularity of the first-generation 3 Series that debuted in 1976. Along with increased sales came an increase in personnel. By the early 1980s, BMW of North America had outgrown the buildings it had leased from Hoffman Motors as part of the settlement by which it secured the right to sell and distribute BMW automobiles in the US.

First among those was the corporate headquarters and parts distribution center in Montvale, New Jersey, which had opened just a few years before BMW NA moved in on [ADDRESS], 1975. Hoffman was known to appreciate fine architecture—he’d commissioned Frank Lloyd Wright to design a showroom on Park Avenue in Manhattan as well as his personal residence in Rye, New York— and the Montvale building was a great example of mid-century Brutalist architecture. The architects of the Montvale building were Rotwein and Blake. Upon entering the building, guests were greeted with an expansive two-story lobby/showroom finished with tan tile floors, a floating staircase and bookmatched, rosewood-paneled walls. At the far end of the lobby showroom, a two-story natural travertine stone wall displayed a stainless-steel BMW roundel and the words “Bavarian Motor Works.”

“It was sort of a strange design,” said Tom McGurn, BMW NA’s first public relations director. “The lobby made a huge statement with rosewood paneling, and it had a lot of glass, but it only had a very small cafeteria, and the offices were a mishmash of sizes.” The largest office, of course, had been Hoffman’s, which McGurn described as “very over-the-top.”

“Hoffman wanted to create an aura and did,” McGurn said. “His desk was semi-circular, so you were a long way away from him. The chairs for the guests were very low, so when you sat in them the desk was almost chest-high. Hoffman wasn’t very large, and his chair was definitely elevated. After [BMW of North America’s first CEO] Jack Cook inherited the office, he remodeled fairly quickly. Jack was not an elevated-chair kind of guy.”

Beyond the oddities of the layout and decor, the Hoffman building had been designed for a company that was selling some 13,000 cars per year. It was simply too small for a company selling five times that number, as BMW was doing a decade after taking over from Hoffman. By the early 1980s, BMW NA had around 370 employees working out of several buildings scattered around Montvale. “We were bursting at the seams,” McGurn said. “At one point, the marketing department was in a building across the parking lot, and so was the senior vice-president of operations. Other offices were half a mile away. It just wasn’t unified.”

To make matters worse, it was becoming increasingly difficult to insist that the dealer network invest in facilities that displayed a unified BMW corporate identity when BMW NA itself was far from compliant.

Furthermore, the Montvale location was far from the freeway—commercial truck traffic is forbidden on the adjacent Garden State Parkway—and the large trucks delivering parts and vehicles had to traverse narrow, twisty residential roads to reach the distribution center.

It was time for a new headquarters, and getting one built would be the responsibility of Dr. Günther Kramer, who succeeded Cook as BMW NA’s chief executive officer. [ADDRESS] years old, Kramer had earned his doctorate in law in 1970, and he’d been BMW AG’s chief legal officer from 1973 until his arrival at NA in 1983.

Two years later, Kramer announced that the company’s activities would soon be united under one roof. BMW had purchased 40 acres of land in Woodcliff Lake, about four miles from Montvale and visible from the Garden State Parkway. The property had been an apple orchard, and it featured a small lake and wooded area along its back edge. The new three-story headquarters building was designed by CUH2A architects of Princeton, with exterior panels of white porcelain enamel setting off grey glass windows. The building’s three offset cube layout, premium materials, and clean, unadorned surfaces emphasized crisp white facades that provided the perfect contrast to the Bavarian blue of the company logo. As such, it mirrored the corporate identity BMW wanted its dealers to adopt.

CUH2A did a masterful job of integrating the modern headquarters into the partially manicured and partially natural wooded landscape of the property. The building was almost hidden from the residential street (Chestnut Ridge Road) at the front of the building, yet it showcased BMW’s presence to the traffic flowing down the Garden State Parkway at the rear. At the same time, it provided BMW employees with beautiful, park-like views from its expansive windows. Construction began in September 1986, and work was completed by the end of 1988. Employees packed up their desks in Montvale on a Friday, and by the following Monday they were working in new offices at 300 Chestnut Ridge Road in Woodcliff Lake. The new building was large enough to contain all of the divisional offices for North America. Its layout— three staggered cubes—provided for a multitude of executive corner offices on two levels throughout. The lowest level housed a state-of-the-art video studio, computer server room, a barber shop, and a dry-cleaning service. A large cafeteria marked a huge improvement over that in the Hoffman building, with indoor and outdoor dining areas, three stories of floor-to-ceiling windows looking onto the woods, and a wide variety of food options at subsidized prices. Finally, the building had an abundant number of meeting rooms that could welcome dealers and suppliers, plus a well-equipped auditorium with vehicle access for larger meetings.

“Everything was consolidated,” McGurn said. “The dealer council no longer had to meet in a hotel, since we had our own conference rooms. We had an auditorium-type room where we could hold an all-employee meeting, which was so convenient.”

To alleviate the parts warehouse trucking issues, a new parts distribution center was built in an industrial area in Mount Olive, New Jersey, some 50 miles away and just off the [ADDRESS] freeway.

BMW NA continued to lease the old Hoffman building in Montvale through 2011. As a result of the headquarters move, the Hoffman building became the offices for BMW NA’s Eastern Region handling sales, marketing, aftersales, center development, and other functions for the northeastern US. The Montvale building’s shop space, meanwhile, was used for car and motorcycle technical training and to service company vehicles. The remaining offices nearby were vacated as their leases expired.

[ADDRESS] Building, as it was affectionally known, underwent several renovations over its three decades of service as the headquarters for BMW NA. As the company expanded, additional property was purchased and buildings added to the campus.

Somewhat sadly, an era ended on [ADDRESS], 2024. [ADDRESS] Building was officially vacated, and employees moved into a new BMW of North America LLC headquarters at 200 BMW Drive in Woodcliff Lake.

Munich. Calder, Lichtenstein, Warhol, Holzer, Hockney, Koons, Rauschenberg, Mahlangu, Eliasson, Baldessari, Cao Fei, Mehretu. For the past 50 years, the #BMW Art Car series has provided artists fascinated by automobiles with a perfect playground for art and design, technology and innovation, motorsport and engineering. The collection of 20 BMW Art Cars embodies the essence of global cultural engagement with over one hundred initiatives across contemporary art, music and film, as well as design. The "rolling sculptures" – from Alexander Calder’s first-ever Art Car to Julie Mehretu’s latest – offer a cross-section of art history over the past five decades: minimalism, pop art, magical realism, abstraction, conceptual art and digital art are all represented.

“I love that car. It has turned out better than the artwork.” Andy Warhol, BMW Art Car #4, 1979

The artists are selected by international juries of museum directors. In close collaboration with the BMW Group’s engineering and design teams, they freely develop their concepts and inspire everyone involved. To mark the 50th anniversary, the BMW Art Car World Tour features an exhibition programme spanning all five continents and including numerous accompanying events.

“The car should not only race in a physical way but also in the heart.” Cao Fei, BMW Art Car #18, 2016

An anniversary around the world.

"The BMW Art Car Collection celebrates 50 years of artistic freedom and visionary design. [ADDRESS] vehicles have become international icons, telling stories of society, technology and performance. Our commitment to art and culture is long-term. We are continuously developing the collection and bringing art and automotive culture together in a unique way," says [EXECUTIVE_OFFICER], Board Member for Human Resources and Real Estate at BMW Group.

The BMW #Art Car World Tour kicks off in Europe and Asia. [ADDRESS]-21 March, the BMW Art Cars created by Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg, David Hockney and Jeff Koons will be on display at the Museum of Applied Arts and the SPARK Art Fair in Vienna for the BMW Group Niederlassung Wien event “(R)Evolution of Art”. The latest and 20th BMW Art Car – the BMW M Hybrid V8 by renowned American painter Julie Mehretu – will embark on an Asian tour and be displayed at Art Basel in Hong Kong on 28-30 March.

Mehretu is developing her Art Car project far beyond the vehicle as an object and will host workshops for young film and media artists across five African countries in 2025, together with film producer Mehret Mandefro and the BMW Group. The results of the African Film and Media Arts Collective (AFMAC) will be presented in 2026 alongside Mehretu's Art Car in an exhibition at the Zeitz MOCAA in Cape Town, curated by its Executive Director, Koyo Kouoh, the designated curator of the #Venice Biennale 2026.

“The whole BMW Art Car project is about invention, about imagination, about pushing limits of what can be possible.” Julie Mehretu, BMW Art Car #20, 2024

Important museums and platforms for classic automobiles are also celebrating the milestone anniversary of the BMW Art Cars. The 13th Art Car by Sandro Chia will be showcased at the classic car festival Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este at Lake Como in May. In July and August, the Louwman Museum in The Hague will present eight BMW Art Cars in a special exhibition.

“I also thought it would be nice if women could participate other than standing around in bikinis.” Jenny Holzer, BMW Art Car #15, 1999

The #BMW Museum , the home of the BMW Art Cars when they are not travelling the world, is also honouring the collection by combining two anniversaries in a special exhibition. The BMW 3 Series is also celebrating its 50th anniversary in 2025, and starting 16 June, the museum will showcase a historical overview of all BMW 3 Series models as well as the BMW M3 Art Cars by Sandro Chia, Michael Jagamara Nelson, and Ken Done.

“I think mobile museums would be a good idea. This car is the fulfilment of my dream. I would like to do ten more.” Robert Rauschenberg, BMW Art Car #6, 1986

New Art Car book, new Art Car model, new Art Car fashion collection.

In addition to the exhibition programme, BMW is releasing various new art and lifestyle products in celebration of the anniversary. [ADDRESS]:18-scale miniature of the 20th Art Car by Julie Mehretu is available for purchase across BMW Lifestyle Shops, with a 1:43 version to follow later in the year. Together with publisher Hatje Cantz, BMW is presenting the third edition of the "BMW Art Cars" catalogue. Interviews with the founders of the collection and essays on each of the 20 Art Cars highlight the art historical relevance and diversity of the works. The cover design of the new edition is by Julie Mehretu. Following the popular Alexander Calder and Roy Lichtenstein fashion collections, the third collaboration with Puma based on the BMW Art Cars will be announced later this year.

“So you can say, the BMW Art Car is definitely a typical Baldessari and the fastest artwork I ever created!” John Baldessari, BMW Art Car #19, 2016

Born from passion: a brief history of the BMW Art Car Collection.

[ADDRESS] June 1975, the BMW 3.0 CSL designed by American sculptor Alexander Calder took to the track at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. The project was initially intended as a one-time collaboration between the artist and BMW. The audience cheered for the colourful racing car and children rejoiced. BMW decided this had to continue! It all began with the passion for art and motorsport of French auctioneer and racing driver Hervé Poulain. In 1975, Poulain found a visionary ally in Jochen Neerpasch, founder and Head of BMW Motorsport, for his plan to enter a BMW designed by an artist in the legendary Le Mans endurance race. Even though the first BMW Art Car retired from the race after seven hours, it became a true crowd favourite, laying the foundations for the collection.

“Hervé, win! But drive carefully!” Alexander Calder, BMW Art Car #1, 1975

In close collaboration with legendary New York gallerist Leo Castelli, BMW Art Cars by American artists such as Frank Stella, Roy Lichtenstein and Andy Warhol followed – and all were raced by Hervé Poulain and the BMW team at Le Mans. From 1982 to 1992, the BMW Art Car Collection opened up to the world, with artists transforming various standard production models: Ernst Fuchs, Robert Rauschenberg, Michael Jagamara Nelson, Ken Done, Matazo Kayama, César Manrique, A. R. Penck, Esther Mahlangu, Sandro Chia and David Hockney. In 1999, BMW returned to motorsport with the BMW V12 LMR prototype and American conceptual artist Jenny Holzer. Eight years later, Olafur Eliasson designed "Your mobile expectations: BMW H₂R Project" based on a record-breaking hydrogen race car. Jeff Koons, John Baldessari, Cao Fei, and Julie Mehretu have added dynamic race cars over the past 15 years. Since its invention nearly 140 years ago, artists worldwide have engaged with the automobile both critically and enthusiastically. And over the last 50 years, the BMW Art Car series has contributed significantly to this inspiring dialogue.

“These race cars are like life, they are bursting with power and have enormous energy. My ideas are meant to merge with this power – it's all about fully embracing it.” Jeff Koons, BMW Art Car #17, 2010

# The story behind the colours of a BMW: From the history and tradition of classic colours to the range of over 150 BMW Individual colours.
## • Colours are more than simply design – they express emotions and identity. They reflect lifestyles, make statements, and define character. • BMW transforms colour into an experience.
Date: 2025-08-26 | Author: Julian Arguelles BMW Group | ID: T0452127EN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BMW offers an impressive range of paint finishes – from legendary classics to innovative shades – allowing customers to express their individuality with precision. With over 150 exclusive colours, BMW Individual highlights the brand’s dedication to personalisation.

Whether symbolising dynamism, elegance, or technological progress, the BMW colour schemes define each model and turn every vehicle into an expression of personality and innovation.

Colours as a mirror of society

The meaning of colours extends far beyond their aesthetic effect. They capture the spirit of society and become symbols of the values and moods of an era. Radiant colours such as sunny yellow and coral red symbolise optimism and energy and represent new beginnings, joie de vivre, and a dynamic outlook.

In contrast, neutral and restrained tones such as silver, grey, and beige emphasise technical precision and continuity.

Colours reflect personal preferences and societal values. They evolve with trends and thus become a key part of cultural communication.

Historic colours that define BMW

Blue and white are inextricably linked with the history of BMW. These colours represent the Bavarian roots of BMW as well as innovation and progress.

Colour nuances such as Estoril blue – a timeless metallic blue that balances style and dynamism – or Le Mans blue – a powerful shade that conveys strength – reflect this approach. With striking accents such as Techno Violet, BMW unites tradition and modernity, thereby creating a distinctive design signature. Even Carbon Black Metallic, an iconic paint finish that became popular with the fourth-generation BMW M5, changes from deep black to a metallic dark blue depending on the incidence of light.

At BMW, white stands for clarity and minimalism. Since models such as the legendary first BMW M3, this colour has been closely associated with the motorsport tradition of BMW. Timeless Alpine White emphasises the precise lines and gives the bodywork a bold and purist look whilst Mineral White Metallic or Frozen Solid White stand out with modern accents and a subtle colour effect.

How colours shape the character of the vehicle

Colours play a decisive role in the perception of a vehicle. They shape the first impression, define the character of a model, and are inextricably linked to its identity. At BMW, the launch colours create defining impressions right from the start. They create a visual link between the vehicle and its alignment – whether dynamic, elegant, or powerful.

An intense blue or vibrant green emphasises sportiness and innovation, and subtle shades such as grey or black embody a timeless presence. At the launch of the Saloon and Touring versions of the seventh-generation BMW M5, Isle of Man Green Metallic perfectly balanced sportiness and elegance whilst Frozen Deep Grey boldly accentuated its powerful, athletic design.

BMW Individual: colour variety and exclusivity

With over 150 exclusive special paint finishes, BMW Individual offers a limitless palette for personalising vehicles. Whether fascinating two-tone paintwork for the BMW 7 Series – a pinnacle of the art of painting that sets standards in exclusivity and aesthetics – or sophisticated iridescent effects: Every colour choice turns the vehicle into a bold statement.

The Frozen colours are a particular highlight of the BMW Individual portfolio. These matt paints not only stand out with their elegant appearance but also uniquely emphasise the lines of a vehicle and accentuate its silhouette. Frozen colours blend elegance with modern design. Thanks to advanced paint technology, they offer durability, easy maintenance, and lasting colour stability – making them ideal for daily use.

With the BMW Individual Visualizer digital platform of BMW, colour design becomes an interactive experience. It allows users to explore and visualise options in 3D. A wide range of special paint finishes allows maximum flexibility so that colours and surfaces can be precisely matched to the character of the vehicle.

Innovative materials such as carbon fibre also open up fascinating design possibilities. The M Carbon Exterior Package makes it possible to create high-contrast accents in terms of colour and surface texture.

Harmony of exterior and interior

The perfect coordination of exterior and interior reflects a holistic design approach. BMW combines a harmonious overall experience with a wide range of customisation options.

Customers can add sporty touches – like a Frozen Black exterior with red leather – or opt for understated elegance with Mineral White and a beige interior. This connection reflects BMW’s philosophy of individualisation: each customer is unique and has distinct characteristics and tastes. Uniqueness that can be expressed in the form of a customised vehicle.

Colour combines innovation and excellence

BMW combines maximum precision with cutting-edge technology and sets new standards in the automotive industry. As a pioneer, BMW introduced the Integrated Paint Process (IPP) in 2006. This technology reduces emissions and minimises energy consumption by dispensing with otherwise standard process steps. BMW ensures a flawless finish whilst seamlessly blending efficiency and premium quality.

Technical excellence is also evident in exclusive projects. The BMW M850i xDrive Gran Coupé in THE 8 X JEFF KOONS edition combines eleven layers of paint – applied by hand in over 200 hours – with a unique design.

The colour gradient of the BMW Skytop – from warm reddish brown to muted silver with a chrome shadow effect – creates harmony between the interior and exterior whilst highlighting its elegant design. These paint finishes illustrate how technology and craftsmanship are seamlessly combined at BMW

How BMW combines tradition and innovation

The BMW colour palettes blend tradition with cutting-edge technology. They set industry standards and give each model a distinct personality. At BMW, colour is more than just a design feature – it is an expression of innovation, joy, and individuality.

# BMW x SipaBoards: bringing riding pleasure, innovation and electric lifestyle to the water.
## +++ BMW expands electric innovation into water sports +++ Highly efficient electric motor +++ Connected, self-inflating stand-up paddleboard (SUP) +++ Innovative mounting system for attaching accessories quickly +++ User interface on the carbon-fibre paddle inspired by the BMW Neue Klasse +++ Lifestyle Accessory Capsule contains, among other things, an Insta360 X5 camera and stylish clothing from the BMW range +++ Graphics concept by BMW Group Designworks, derived from the Neue Klasse +++ Collaboration with SipaBoards, the world’s leading specialist in e-SUP construction +++

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Munich. BMW is bringing innovation and electric mobility into new areas of life with its new electric stand-up paddleboard (SUP). The BMW x SipaBoards is the product of a collaboration with Slovenian manufacturer SipaBoards, the market leader in the field. The boards are self-inflating and combine electric drive technology with high-grade materials, digital connectivity and a flexible energy system. This is the first time BMW has offered an electrically powered product designed for water sports, opening up a new chapter in riding pleasure in the process. BMW Group Designworks took care of the visuals.

Electric lifestyle on the water.

Stand-up paddleboarding has grown into an extremely popular, on-trend sport over recent years. It brings together physical activity, immersion in nature and low barriers to entry – and therefore appeals to first-timers and experienced water sports enthusiasts alike. The BMW x SipaBoards brings a new dimension to the paddleboarding experience in the form of electric assistance, connectivity and intuitive control. The result is a new level of mobility on the water and the confluence of comfort and adventure.

At the heart of the BMW x SipaBoards is an integrated motor generating up to 300 watts of power. It produces additional thrust while on the move and makes paddling easier – especially into headwinds or currents. The drivetrain, with a propeller developed specifically for BMW, runs emission-free and near silently, and delivers a unique riding experience at speeds of up to 7.5 km/h (4 knots). The motor also comes in handy by pumping up the board automatically before you head out. The requisite energy is supplied by battery modules, which are available with a range of different capacities – to respond to individual requirements – and can be swapped out in just a few simple steps.

Structural solidity and extensive connectivity.

Its specially developed X-woven drop-stitch core gives the e-SUP superb structural rigidity and stability. The board is intuitive to use, via a new user interface (UI) with Bluetooth remote control – whose design was inspired by the BMW Neue Klasse – built into the paddle. It allows the rider to toggle into FREUDE Mode for extra power, eye-catching light effects and haptic feedback. A smartphone app brings additional functionality, enabling users to plan routes, for example, monitor the battery charge and utilise GPS tracking. An additional safety feature is the automatic power cut-off, which is triggered by a Bluetooth signal. If the paddle falls into the water, a return signal is immediately transmitted that automatically cuts the motor. This means the board remains under control at all times, including in unexpected situations, and makes riding extremely safe.

Fun for up to two people per SUP.

The board and all-carbon-fibre paddle fuse robustness with lightness, and deliver an exceptional on-the-water riding experience. The board is 3.65 m long, 0.82 m wide, 0.15 m thick and weighs 10.9 kilograms (14.9 kg including the motor). It is designed to carry two people. The design was developed by BMW Group Designworks and draws parallels with the design language of the BMW Neue Klasse models. It spans the board, carbon-fibre paddle and accessories, and underscores the classy and cohesive overall look. Three colour variants are available. All the materials employed are extremely durable, which means they are good for sustainability and ideally suited to handling changing conditions on the water. The board runs quietly and with zero emissions.

Intelligent mounting system opens up a multitude of possibilities.

Another special feature of the BMW x SipaBoards is the innovative mounting system, which allows accessories to be attached quickly to a large number of points on the e-SUP. For example, cameras, speakers, drinks bottles, waterproof bags or even coolboxes can all be fixed in place easily by click & connect and the board customised accordingly. LED ambient lighting underneath the board further enhances the exclusive vibe and provides a helping hand when boarding in the hours of darkness.

BMW also offers a Lifestyle Accessory Capsule, which comes with selected accessories such as an Insta360 X5 camera – allowing users to take incredible shots during a ride – and apparel from the BMW range. All of which means the e-SUP is not only extremely adept functionally, it can also serve as a window into the personal lifestyle of its owner.

Two battery configurations for electric boarding pleasure on the water. The BMW x SipaBoards is offered with two 90 Wh battery modules. This configuration is aimed at owners keen to explore lakes or coastlines, for example, from the water. The batteries enable between one and 3.5 hours of boarding time.

From spring 2026, the board will also be available with two 180 Wh battery modules as an option. These are designed for longer riding times and intended for people planning extended expeditions on the water. With these battery modules specified, users can cruise for between three and seven hours.

The BMW x SipaBoards is available now from the BMW Lifestyle online store, selected SipaBoards retailers and [EXTERNAL_RESOURCE] priced at EUR 3,990.00.

Munich. Excitement was palpable today at Golfclub München Eichenried ahead of the tournament rounds of the 36 th BMW International Open ([ADDRESS]–6, 2025) – among amateurs, who got to play a memorable round with a pro in the Pro-Am tournament, among professionals set to compete for one of the most coveted titles on the DP World Tour starting tomorrow, and among fans, who witnessed a host of celebrities on the course.

The only German winner in the tournament’s history, Martin Kaymer, teed off alongside “Golden Goal” hero Oliver Bierhoff, former national player Tim Borowski, and coach Ralph Hassenhüttl (AUT). A “golden trio” was formed by six-time Olympic luge champions Tobias Wendl and Tobias Arlt (doubles), together with Michael Greis, three-time Olympic biathlon champion. Ice hockey was also well represented by NHL stars Moritz Seider and Tim Stützle, as well as national team player Maximilian Kastner. Former world-class tennis player and record winner of the BMW Open in Munich, Philipp Kohlschreiber, also proved his skills with a golf club.

From the film industry, actors Kai Wiesinger and Kostja Ullmann, as well as director, screenwriter, and producer Florian Gallenberger, joined the event. A native of Munich, Gallenberger won an Oscar in 2001 in the Best Live Action Short Film category. Celebrity photographer Paul Ripke also showed his talents on the championship course.

The first round of the BMW International Open starts on Thursday at 7:30 a.m., with three-player groups teeing off from [ADDRESS] and [ADDRESS].

Quotes from Wednesday.

Martin Kaymer (GER): "The people you work with make all the difference. You can really feel how much passion and attention to detail everyone at BMW puts in. That makes it very pleasant for us players. It's a luxury on the DP World Tour to be able to play here. I’m always grateful and, as a German, proud that we have such a fantastic event. It’s a joy to come here every time.”

Marcel Siem (GER): "I don’t usually say this before a tournament, but I finally want to win here. That’s always my goal when I come. I’ve been coming here since I was a kid and even became club champion. No one knows the course better than I do. I want to win and put on a great show.”

Ewen Ferguson (SCO): "I’ve always loved coming to this tournament. Munich is such a beautiful city. It’s always a pleasure to be here. The course, the event, the infrastructure, the player’s lounge, the food—everything is fantastic. Coming back as the defending champion and seeing my face around the venue is a great feeling.”

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Munich. After an intensive year, the “Class of 2025” has completed the BMW M Racing Academy - BMW M Motorsport’s dedicated support program for talented young drivers from customer racing. Under the close guidance of a team led by three BMW M works drivers, Berkay Besler (TUR), Nerea Martí (ESP), Matt Million (USA), and Niels Tröger (GER) have received comprehensive training and support from BMW M Motorsport over the past months. Following the successful launch of the program, anticipation is already high for the “Class of 2026.”

To conclude their BMW M Racing Academy year, the four members of the “Class of 2025” spent a full week immersed in the world of BMW M Motorsport. At BMW’s headquarters in Munich (GER), Besler, Martí, Million, and Tröger enjoyed a guided tour of BMW Welt and the BMW Museum. They then participated in workshops on social media and brand building – and immediately put their new skills to the test: the group documented their joint road trip to Viareggio (ITA) in a BMW M5 for BMW M Motorsport’s official Instagram channel.

In Viareggio, the quartet once again trained with Formula Medicine – as they had at the beginning of the year – focusing on both their mental and physical performance. Under the professional supervision of Dr. Riccardo Ceccarelli and his globally renowned team, the participants assessed their progress since the program’s start and evaluated their development. The “Class of 2025” also completed a 24-hour race simulation together, gaining firsthand experience of the procedures, challenges, and demands of endurance racing.

Throughout the year, the four drivers accumulated many valuable test kilometers on real racetracks. In Miramas (FRA) and Varano (ITA), they worked side by side with BMW M works drivers on development testing for the new BMW M2 Racing. Martí and Besler also gained insights into BMW M Motorsport’s factory programs by attending the FIA WEC weekend in Imola (ITA), where they met Head of BMW M Motorsport, Andreas Roos and several works drivers. Meanwhile, Million joined BMW M Motorsport at the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship round in Laguna Seca (USA).

The participants were mentored throughout the year by a trio of BMW M works drivers. Jens Klingmann (GER) served as the main point of contact for the “Class of 2025,” supported by Max Hesse (GER) and Robby Foley (USA). The team was completed by Dirk Adorf (GER), who brought his extensive experience from previous talent development programs. Together, they provided expert guidance both on and off the track, offering invaluable advice, analysis, and feedback. Their presence at the participants’ GT4 customer racing events provided an especially valuable learning opportunity through direct, hands-on coaching.

Besler, Martí, Tröger, and Million had earned their places in the Academy after a demanding selection process against a strong field of GT4 drivers last year. The selection for the second generation is already underway – and following the program’s successful debut, everyone involved is eagerly looking forward to the “Class of 2026.”

Statements on the BMW M Racing Academy.

Björn Lellmann, Head of Customer Racing at BMW M Motorsport: “I’m extremely proud that we were able to establish this development program again this year. Supporting talent from the customer racing sector is something both BMW M Motorsport and I personally care deeply about. During the BMW M2 Racing tests, the four participants made important contributions to development work, benefitting everyone involved. It was fascinating to watch how our ‘Class of 2025’ evolved both on and off the track. My thanks go to our BMW M works drivers Jens, Max, and Robby for their intense and constructive mentoring, which makes this program so special. We’re all very eager to continue following the progress of Berkay, Nerea, Matt, and Niels. After such a strong debut year, I’m very excited to see what the next generation of the BMW M Racing Academy will bring in 2026.”

Jens Klingmann, BMW M works driver: “It was great that, in the second half of the year, we were able to dive deep into the DNA of BMW – the values, the core business, the history, and the future – to broaden the participants’ understanding as drivers and give them a bigger-picture view. At the start of the program, we worked with Formula Medicine to assess each participant’s physical and mental baseline, and from there we built personalized training plans. Seeing their progress over the year was very rewarding. [ADDRESS]-hour simulation was also crucial for teaching how to approach such an event, manage rest periods, and recover both mentally and physically. For drivers without prior endurance experience, that’s a real eye-opener. Overall, my impression is extremely positive. It was a lot of fun, and we were able to give the participants behind-the-scenes insights that money can’t buy. I’m happy that we could always be there for them – whether analyzing onboard footage, answering questions, or sharing advice. I wish all four of them the very best and hope they can apply everything they’ve learned in the BMW M Racing Academy to their future careers, both on and off the track.”

Berkay Besler, BMW M Racing Academy participant: “Racing for a brand like BMW is already something very special to me, but being part of the BMW family through the Academy made it even more meaningful. Having such close contact with all members of this big organization was incredibly valuable. The relationship with the three mentors was essential – especially since I’ve known Max for a long time and could exchange ideas with him throughout the year. I also spent a lot of time with Jens during the BMW M2 Racing tests, and his influence on my performance has been huge. After every test, we wrote reports to share with him, and after every race, I did race reports with my engineer – something I had never done before. It really helps us improve and analyze our weaknesses. I’ve also adapted my nutrition and training routines based on what I learned at Formula Medicine and use mental techniques during races to enhance my focus. All these experiences will be crucial for my future racing career.”

Nerea Martí, BMW M Racing Academy participant: “The BMW M Racing Academy provided me with a complete preparation both on and off the track. I’m very grateful for the close connection to BMW and the opportunity to learn from everyone involved. I’ve learned to pay attention to small details and to plan my development strategically – from physical and mental preparation to communication and social media presence. The program has taught me how to prepare properly off the track, apply the right training methods, and balance physical and mental aspects to deliver my best performance. The chance to interact with our mentors and everyone involved in the program was incredibly valuable. Their experience, advice, and feedback had a big impact on my growth as a driver, and I’m confident that their guidance will continue to help me in the future.”

Matt Million, BMW M Racing Academy participant: “My key takeaways fall into three categories: professionalism, performance, and in-depth knowledge of BMW M and BMW M Motorsport. The mentors in particular gave me a clear understanding of how to act as a BMW M driver and brand ambassador, both on and off the track. The conversations with Robby Foley and Max Hesse helped me build a framework for planning my next career steps. Overall, the program elevated me in every aspect as a driver and ambassador – from physical and mental training to recovery and team feedback. I’ve also started using media and interview opportunities much more effectively to represent myself and the brand. Sharing my story from the BMW M Racing Academy and my journey feels special. Representing the brand I raced with for years in club racing is personally a magical story for me.”

Niels Tröger, BMW M Racing Academy participant: “The BMW M Racing Academy has given me insights into professional motorsport that you wouldn’t normally get. During the BMW M2 Racing tests, I gained my first experience in race car development, and working directly with the engineers was unique and highly educational. With the help of our mentors, especially Jens, I’ve learned how to give precise feedback to my race engineer. Thanks to our Formula Medicine training, I now prepare for races in a completely different way and can perform much better. All these important experiences have helped me develop further as a driver. Overall, the BMW M Racing Academy has made me a more complete racer.”

Woodcliff Lake, NJ – [ADDRESS], 2025… The BMW Group presents the driving and user experience of the future at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2025 in Las Vegas. BMW is providing the first opportunity to experience the close-to-production version of the new BMW iDrive – complete with its centrepiece, BMW Panoramic Vision – at the event. The software underpinning it all is the new BMW Operating System X, which acts as the intelligence hub behind the new display and operating concept. The holistic system, with its modern, style-shaping design, will be introduced in all new BMW models from the end of 2025. “High tech meets highly intuitive operation – a quarter of a century of pioneering work and technological leadership in operating concepts has been channelled into the new BMW Panoramic iDrive,” says Frank Weber, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, responsible for Development. “The foundations are provided by the new BMW Operating System X. With this advance, we are giving one of the world’s best and most comprehensive infotainment systems even greater capability and once again setting the industry benchmark in multimodal interaction. Starting with the first series-produced Neue Klasse model at the end of this year, the new BMW Panoramic iDrive will form an integral part of all future BMW models.”

Four elements, one goal: consistent driver focus in characteristic BMW style.

The new BMW iDrive merges four central elements into a unique display and operating concept.

BMW Panoramic Vision – a Head-Up Display concept newly developed by BMW for projecting content reflects visible information from A-pillar to A-pillar onto a black printed surface in the lower section of the windscreen. This information is visible to all occupants. The most important driving information is projected directly into the driver's line of sight on the left-hand side of the BMW Panoramic Vision above the steering wheel. The driver can personalise the content in the central and right-hand areas of the BMW Panoramic Vision via the central display. The integration of the BMW Panoramic Vision creates a 3D effect for the driver and passengers.

The combination of these four elements reinterprets BMW’s customary “hands on the wheel, eyes on the road” approach, with which BMW sets the benchmark for driver focus and presents a unique form of intuitive, use-friendly, and ergonomically optimised operation. The BMW Panoramic iDrive always gives the driver the right information in the right place and at the right time. The system continues the approach of using an optimal combination of analogue and digital controls through the use of switches, buttons, touch and voice control. There are haptic switches for the windscreen wipers, turn signal indicators, exterior mirrors, volume control, gear selectors and window de-icers. Other functions are optimised for operation using touch/voice control or via the multifunction steering wheel, such as telephone functions, media control systems, navigation, assisted driving, personalisation of displays, selection of MyModes and much more besides.

Alongside data-driven learnings on the use of BMW Operating Systems across the global fleet of now more than 22 million connected BMW vehicles, the development phase of the new BMW Panoramic iDrive also included numerous studies conducted in the BMW Group’s usability labs, in which around 3,000 customers were involved. Every decision on the various aspects of the operating logic is therefore based on data and made in a structured manner. Here, the user experience’s extended scope for personalization has also been aligned with customer preferences and requirements.

BMW Operating System X: intelligent, versatile, fit for the future.

The new BMW Operating System X represents an update of the latest operating system, as used in many BMW models, and is a wholly in-house development from BMW. Like BMW Operating [ADDRESS], it is based on an Android Open Source Project (AOSP) software stack. It offers even greater update and upgrade capability than the predecessor system, making it both fit for the future and backwards compatible. It is ready to accommodate additional functions and will keep vehicles equipped with the new BMW Panoramic iDrive at the cutting edge of technology over a long period of time.

“The overall concept of the new BMW Panoramic iDrive with Operating System X has been enabled by a large technological leap forward,” says Stephan Durach Senior Vice President Connected Company BMW Group. “It offers intuitive operation, emotionally engaging experiences and specific personalization. The new BMW iDrive with Operating System X demonstrates the potential of a software-defined vehicle.”

The expanded intelligence of BMW Operating System X makes it possible to combine the BMW Panoramic Vision, optional BMW 3D Head-Up Display, central display and multifunction steering wheel with one another in such a way that physical and digital experiences merge. For example, an incoming call initially brings up a graphic on the BMW Panoramic Vision. At the same time, a symbol on the relevant steering wheel button that was not previously visible is illuminated in green, indicating the option of taking the call by pressing the button or rejecting it with a swipe on the right-hand side of the steering wheel.

When a navigation destination is entered by touch control or voice command, route guidance alerts are shown on the BMW 3D Head-Up Display and further information on roads and junctions on the BMW Panoramic Vision. A whole map overview can be shown on the central display at any time for broader-scale orientation.

The personalization of content reaches a new level with BMW Operating System X. The displays in the Panoramic Vision can be adapted to personal preferences. In addition, drivers now also have the option of choosing their own settings for driving attributes such as response and steering characteristics in the My Mode “Personal”. Moreover, pictures chosen by the user can be uploaded as backgrounds for the Central Display and the colourway of the Ambient Lighting and user interface design adjusted to their particular preferences, creating an even more personalized driving experience.

The BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant responds in the accustomed way to the prompt “Hey BMW” or can be called up by pressing the respective button on the multifunction steering wheel. The capabilities of the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant are being constantly enhanced and will be taken to a whole new level for the Neue Klasse through the integration of Large Language Models (LLM). The use of this technology is focused initially on navigation, allowing the customer to give more extensive spoken commands using natural language: for example: “Take me to a charging station which is close to a food store.” At technology partner Amazon’s booth at CES 2025, visitors can get an initial impression of these capabilities using a beta version of this build of the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant in a BMW X3.

As with the current infotainment systems from BMW, the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant can – if the driver desires – make suggestions proactively based on user behaviour. This intelligence expands further with BMW Operating System X. In relevant situations, the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant highlights driver assistance systems, which are rarely used by the driver. As a kind of reminder, the system suggests activating Sport Mode on suitable routes if the driver has already activated Sport Mode independently beforehand. If the driver doesn’t respond to or ignores these proactive suggestions several times, the system learns and refrains from making suggestions from then on.

BMW Operating System X carries over the scope for integration of third-party apps from the previous infotainment generation. As things stand, the BMW ConnectedDrive Store offers more than 60 apps worldwide for BMW Operating [ADDRESS]. The selection will continue to grow, e.g. with productivity apps such as video conferencing service Zoom.

Design and technology for a unique user and driving experience.

The new BMW Panoramic iDrive is scalable and will be integrated into all new BMW models – across all vehicle segments and with all drive system technologies – from the end of 2025.

The driving experience takes centre stage. The driver should feel at ease and have full control over the vehicle. This principle is reflected in the design of the new BMW Panoramic iDrive. Particular attention is paid to the details: the user interface has been designed as intuitively and adaptively as possible to ensure seamless interaction. The result is a holistic experience enhanced by a harmonious combination of sound, light, and innovative design. Every journey becomes a special moment of connection between human and vehicle.

“Technology and customer preferences are changing more quickly than ever. The design of digital experiences and sound is playing an ever more important role,” says Adrian van Hooydonk, Senior Vice President BMW Group Design. “The new BMW Panoramic iDrive not only makes our vehicles smarter and more user-friendly, it also enables much more extensive personalisation, which turns every new BMW into a car that is very much the user’s own.”

Another element in the holistic experience provided by the BMW Panoramic iDrive is the new HypersonX sound experience in the Neue Klasse models. Developed by the BMW Group Sound Design Studio, it comprises 43 sound signals and special driving sounds for Personal Mode and Sport Mode. The multi-dimensional spectrum adapts the sounds precisely to the driving situation at hand and, in so doing, creates an emotional interaction between the driver and their BMW.

Woodcliff Lake, NJ – [ADDRESS], 2025… BMW presents the first series-production Neue Klasse model. The BMW iX3 is a fully electric Sports Activity Vehicle (SAV) that gives customers their first on-the-road taste of a whole new era of The Ultimate Driving Machine. An all-new design language gives the iX3 a character-rich appearance that faithfully conveys the technological progress made by the new model. With sixth-generation BMW eDrive technology, a range of up to 400 miles (estimated range of up to 400 miles according to preliminary BMW AG tests based on the EPA’s test procedure standards) and a peak charging rate of 400 kW, the new BMW iX3 sets new standards for efficiency and long-distance capability. A new electronics and software architecture including four “superbrain” high-performance computers makes the first Neue Klasse model more intelligent and better equipped for the future than ever. The “Heart of Joy” drivetrain and driving dynamics management technology enables unmatched poise, assurance, and precision, while the latest systems for automated driving optimize symbiotic human-vehicle interaction.

A defining element of the digital user experience in the new BMW iX3 is the BMW Panoramic iDrive, which elevates intuitive operation and the driver focus to a new level. And an all-encompassing sustainability concept reduces the iX3’s product carbon footprint over its lifecycle by more than 30% compared to previous electric BMW models.

The first Neue Klasse model will be built at the newly constructed BMW Group plant in Debrecen, Hungary. The first variant of the fully electric SAV to roll off the production line will be the BMW iX3 50 xDrive with an output of 463 hp and dual-motor all-wheel drive. Further fully electric variants will follow, including a single-motor rear-wheel drive model. The market launch of the new BMW iX3 will commence in the US in the summer of 2026.

The new BMW iX3 represents a leap forward in development and a milestone in the transformation process when it comes to electrification, digitalization, and circularity. Spearheading the arrival of the Neue Klasse, the iX3 offers customers the latest design and technology innovations, which will shape the brand’s entire model range moving forward. The technologies introduced in the Neue Klasse will be incorporated into nearly 40 new models and model updates between now and 2027.

“The Neue Klasse is our biggest future-focused project and marks a huge leap forward in terms of technologies, driving experience, and design,” says [EXECUTIVE_OFFICER], Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG. “Practically everything about it is new, yet it is also more BMW than ever. Our whole product range will benefit from the innovations brought by the Neue Klasse – whichever drive system technology is employed. What started as a bold vision has now become reality: the BMW iX3 is the first Neue Klasse model to go into series production, kicking off a new era for BMW.”

Launch of the new design language: reduced, characterful, and timeless.

The new BMW iX3 will launch the new BMW design language, which will expand across the whole of BMW’s range as new models and variants are introduced. This new use of forms provides a very modern interpretation of BMW’s original and enduring blueprint. For this reason, comprehensive design protection has been registered for the new BMW design language used in the new BMW iX3.

“The design of the Neue Klasse provides a very modern interpretation of what BMW has always stood for,” says Adrian van Hooydonk, Head of BMW Group Design. “With our new design language, the new BMW iX3 looks future-focused, modern, and timeless – but, above all, more BMW than ever.”

[ADDRESS].3 inches long, 74.6 inches wide, and 64.4 inches tall, the new BMW iX3 has the hallmark proportions of a BMW SAV. The characteristic two-box design is infused with the authoritative presence of a BMW X model and has a reduced surface treatment that emphasizes all four wheels. Created squarely and exclusively for electric vehicles, the vehicle architecture enables an extremely favorable ratio of exterior size to interior space. The BMW iX3 has a 114.1-inch wheelbase and track widths of 64.1 inches at the front axle and 64.3 inches at the rear.

The front end: new interpretation of the classic four-eyed face.

The upright front end gives the new BMW iX3 a commanding presence. Large air intakes and a black band in the lower section of the front apron accentuate the robust sportiness of this BMW X model. Added to which, the reduced surface treatment allows the distinctive BMW kidneys and twin headlights to take center stage. An all-new horizontal light signature takes the place of chrome trim elements, lending the front end a sense of quality and sophistication. The redesigned BMW roundel is embedded above the kidneys in the “valley” of the hood.

Evocative of iconic Neue Klasse vehicles of the 60s and 70s such as the 1600 and 2002, the sculpted BMW kidneys are vertically arranged. Embedding the kidneys into the surface of the front apron emphasizes their contours further still. There is also a new take on the signature BMW four-eyed face created by the headlights. Here, vertical, slightly outward-slanting daytime driving light elements with indicator functions produce the unwavering gaze on the road familiar from BMW’s past. Additional horizontal light surfaces, which create a distinct sense of depth and extend up to the BMW kidneys, add the finishing touches to the new light signature. Together with the optional illuminated BMW kidneys, they bring a unique lighting effect to the front of the new BMW iX3.

Side view combines powerful stature with lightness.

In the vehicle’s flanks, generously proportioned surfaces accentuated by a small number of precise lines create a character-rich appearance. The design appears as if cut from a single mold thanks to flowing transitions into the front and rear ends. The muscular stature of the new BMW iX3 is underscored by fully body-color wheel arches subtly rectangular contours. In contrast, the glazed areas in the upper section of the vehicle body exude an elegant sense of lightness. The slim side windows and slightly downward-sloping roofline optimize aerodynamics. Hidden seals allow the vehicle body to transition directly into the glass surfaces, producing a harmonious side view. A character line positioned low down in the flanks emphasizes the height of the iX3 and suggests a dynamically stretched profile. The door handles are integrated flush into the doors and extend automatically when the standard BMW Digital Key approaches.

[ADDRESS]-inch alloy wheels fitted as standard underscore the SAV’s powerful appearance. Painstaking aerodynamic optimization enables a drag coefficient (C d ) of 0.24.

Rear end with athletic shoulders and a new light signature.

The clear design language, focusing on the essentials, continues at the rear of the new BMW iX3. As at the front, the dominant theme in the upper section of the rear is large surfaces detailed by a small number of lines, creating a technical, modern aesthetic. The lower section of the rear apron, meanwhile, generates greater visual impact, with the robust yet sporting character of the new BMW iX3 underscored by a black band and a diffuser element.

When viewed from the rear, the eye is drawn to the athletic shoulders of the body and the heavily tapered – and therefore aerodynamic – greenhouse. The visual emphasis of the wheel arches accentuates the iX3’s width and robust stance on the road. This effect is enhanced by the expansive, horizontally arranged rear lights. The BMW iX3 also has a new light signature at the rear. Its light sources are split through several levels and develop a vivid sense of depth. The individual light sources of the rear lights on the new iX3 are arranged in the familiar BMW “L” shape.

The standard roof spoiler further raises the visual dynamism of the new BMW iX3. Echoing the “valley” in the front hood, the spoiler has a central recess that continues into the space between the rear lights, where it creates a perfect stage for the updated BMW logo.

Interior design: modern space has a BMW-typical driver focus and offers exceptional comfort for all passengers.

The design of the BMW iX3 interior sets new standards in terms of modernity and digital experience. The interior has an uncluttered, reduced design, providing the ideal stage for the digital experience. The cabin is all about a clear driver focus and comfort for all those on board. Created specifically for electric vehicles, the vehicle architecture allows for generous levels of space in all five seats. The lines of the “floating” instrument panel flow directly into the large door trim panels, creating an enveloping wrap-around effect for the passengers. With its textile surface, the instrument panel – with atmospheric backlighting – contributes to the warm and inviting atmosphere inside. Large window surfaces and the optional Panoramic moonroof with climate comfort glazing create an ambience bathed in light.

Another prominent influence in the horizontally arranged cockpit is the new BMW Panoramic iDrive, which is based on the likewise newly developed BMW Operating System X. It brings together displays, geometry, and light and sound design into a holistic experience, customizable via My Modes. Also contributing to the prevailing atmosphere are the new driving sounds, sound effects, and sound signals of the BMW HypersonX soundscape created specifically for the Neue Klasse.

Newly designed seats in a choice of interior colors and materials.

The newly designed seats in the new BMW iX3 offer high levels of comfort over long distances, firm lateral support, and a wide range of adjustment. Thick seat cushions extending downward and the absence, to a large extent, of plastic trim give the seats an elegant appearance. With their distinctive contours, the head restraints also contribute to the progressive style of the interior design.

As standard, the seats are upholstered in perforated Veganza in Black Bicolor, Digital White Bicolor, or Castanea Bicolor. Optionally, customers may select Black in a combination of M PerformTex and Veganza or BMW Individual Merino Leather, also in Black.

In the front section of the center console is a storage space with a wireless device charging pad, two USB-C ports, and two cup holders separated by an illuminated triangular trim element. Behind it are the gear selector, a roller switch for adjusting the audio system volume, and the physical buttons for the parking brake, rear window heating, windscreen defrosting, and hazard warning lights. Below the center console, a storage space with indirect illumination offers additional room for stowing items.

The luggage compartment of the new BMW iX3 measures 30.4 cu ft, which can be expanded to 65 cu ft by folding down the rear seats as required. An additional 2 cu ft storage compartment under the front hood is available for smaller items. Customers needing additional capacity can specify the optional trailer hitch with a towing capacity of up to 4,400 lbs.

BMW Panoramic iDrive. Four elements with a single goal: complete driver focus.

The BMW iX3 is the first series-production model in which BMW Panoramic iDrive redefines the user experience. With its neatly judged balance between digital functions and physical elements, BMW Panoramic iDrive elevates intuitive operation – according to BMW’s “hands on the wheel, eyes on the road” principle – to a new level of driver focus. The entire system – consisting of the BMW Panoramic Vision, the multifunction steering wheel, the Central Display, and the optional BMW 3D Head-Up Display – is born out of decades of experience and a user-centric design approach. Individual customer feedback, data from over 10 million connected vehicles, and usability studies with more than 3,000 customers were all incorporated into the development process. Physical controls are on hand for the windscreen wipers, turn signal indicators, exterior mirrors, volume control, gear selector, parking brake, hazard warning lights, rear window heating, and defrost function. Other functions have been optimized for use by touch and voice command or via the multifunction steering wheel.

The BMW Panoramic Vision is a newly developed display concept from BMW for projecting content directly onto the lower section of the windscreen, where information appears on a black printed surface stretching from A-pillar to A-pillar. The information is visible to all occupants and promises a new dimension in driver focus.

The most important driving information is projected directly into the driver’s line of sight on the left-hand side of the BMW Panoramic Vision, above the steering wheel. The driver is able to personalize content in the central and right-hand areas of the BMW Panoramic Vision via the Central Display. The way the BMW Panoramic Vision is integrated creates a 3D effect for the driver and passengers.

The new optional BMW 3D Head-Up Display positioned above the BMW Panoramic Vision now shows integrated navigation and automated driving graphics in the driver’s immediate field of vision. The content in the BMW Panoramic Vision and BMW 3D Head-Up Display is presented in a neatly coordinated way.

BMW has filed several patent applications resulting from the development of the projection technologies used in the two displays, underlining just how much innovation has gone into them.

[ADDRESS].9-inch Central Display with matrix backlight technology features a further improved version of the familiar QuickSelect menu structure to enable optimum operation of functions and content by touch. The Central Display’s home screen continuously shows the BMW Maps navigation system’s map view or other individually configurable content. Also to be found on this level are vertically arranged widgets on the driver’s side, which the user can switch between by swiping. The QuickSelect feature allows important functions to be accessed directly without having to enter a submenu. Swiping a widget horizontally then displays additional related information and settings options. Operation is highly ergonomic thanks to the Central Display’s shape and positioning in close proximity to the steering wheel. Users can return to the home screen from any of the submenus with a tap of the finger on the home icon at the lower edge of the Central Display. Quick access icons for music, navigation, phone calls, the All Apps menu, and the vehicle settings menu are also located here. There is also menu on the Central Display containing widgets that can be moved to the BMW Panoramic Vision by drag and drop. Up to six widgets can be configured in this way.

The new multifunction steering wheel employs BMW’s shy-tech approach, meaning available functions are indicated by illuminating the corresponding buttons. It thereby serves as the primary physical control point, whose buttons provide active haptic feedback. The buttons’ finely designed, relief-like surfaces provide optimum orientation and enable the driver to control functions manually without needing to take their eyes off the road. The buttons have been arranged in accordance with the customary principle of placing driving assistance functions on the left side of the steering wheel and functions for controlling infotainment and communications features on the right.

BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant with major improvements for natural interaction.

The BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant plays a key role in the BMW iX3 operating concept, serving as an adaptive assistant that turns the iX3 into an intelligent digital companion. Besides the addition of two new voices, its appearance has also been completely redesigned for the BMW Panoramic Vision. The assistant can be summoned in the usual way with the prompt “Hey BMW” or the push of a button on the steering wheel’s right-hand control panel. The Intelligent Personal Assistant is positioned in the center of the BMW Panoramic Vision by default following initial setup. It is able to react appropriately to the specific context with a range of engaging, lively animations. Following prolonged periods of inactivity, the assistant recedes into the background on a visual level by transforming into the BMW logo. The assistant can control the windows, air conditioning, seating comfort, phone calls, in-car entertainment, and more. It can also be used to call up many function menus or operate certain apps.

If the driver so chooses, the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant is also able to offer proactive suggestions based on usage patterns and other factors. BMW Operating System X further expands this intelligent capability by taking far more contexts into account, e.g. from the environmental situation. In the case of driver assistance systems that are fitted but seldom used, for instance, the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant will point them out to the driver in suitable situations. If the vehicle is being driven in a sporty manner on entertaining stretches of road, the assistant will propose activating My Mode Sport. And if the driver misses a call, the assistant will suggest returning the call in the widget on the Central Display. If the driver doesn’t react to the proactive prompts repeatedly or if individual suggestions are frequently rejected, the intelligent system will take note of this and refrain from making suggestions in future.

The Routines function further expands the ways in which the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant can help the driver. In the same way people have their daily morning routine of, say, first switching on the coffee maker then scrolling through the day’s news, drivers are now able to easily teach the assistant routines for the ultimate in personal driving pleasure. If the steering wheel heating, seat heating, and defrost function are all switched on at the start of every journey in winter, for instance, these same actions can be simply combined into a routine.

Additional functions will be provided to customers in future via software updates in order to keep improving and expanding the capabilities of the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant.

Underpinning BMW Panoramic iDrive is the newly developed BMW Operating System X, which offers extensive scope for personalization via the BMW ID, intelligent driver assistance, a wide variety of digital functions, extensive connectivity using the My BMW App, and outstanding future-proofing thanks to BMW Software Updates.

Sixth-generation BMW eDrive technology: higher efficiency, more range, faster charging.

The sixth-generation BMW eDrive technology developed for the Neue Klasse comprises highly efficient electric motors, fundamentally new high-voltage batteries with cylindrical cells, and 800V technology. The BMW iX3 50 xDrive is powered by two electric motors which generate a combined output of 463 hp and 476 lb-ft of torque, enabling a trip from 0-60 mph in an estimated 4.7 seconds and a top speed of 130 mph. Its electric all-wheel-drive configuration consists of an extensively upgraded and highly efficient Electrically Excited Synchronous Motor (EESM) at the rear axle and a new Asynchronous Motor (ASM) at the front. The combination of EESM and ASM is evidence of BMW’s commitment to technological openness within electric mobility. The drive technology developed for the Neue Klasse reduces energy losses by 40% compared to fifth-generation BMW eDrive technology, weight by 10%, and manufacturing costs by 20%.

In the Electrically Excited Synchronous Motor (EESM) at the rear axle, the rotor’s magnetic field is generated by an excitation current from an external source rather than permanent magnets. As with the Gen5 version, this synchronous motor features a compact housing incorporating the electric drive unit, power electronics and transmission. Unlike the Gen5 drivetrain, Gen6 employs a second electric motor technology in the form of an Asynchronous Motor (ASM). The ASM at the front axle works on the principle of induction, so neither permanent magnets nor an external excitation current are required.

The new high-voltage battery concept with lithium-ion cylindrical cells for the Neue Klasse also achieves significant advances. The energy density on a cell level is 20% higher than with fifth-generation BMW eDrive technology, and also enables a 30% increase in charging speed. The cylindrical cells are integrated directly into the high-voltage battery (“cell to pack”), which benefits energy density and cost efficiency. Added to which, the high-voltage battery is integrated into the vehicle architecture as a structural component to minimize weight (“pack to open body”). The high-voltage battery in the BMW iX3 50 xDrive enables a range of up to 400 miles (estimated range of up to 400 miles according to preliminary BMW AG tests based on the EPA’s test procedure standards).

BMW Charging: short charging times, premiere of bi-directional charging.

The advances brought by sixth-generation BMW eDrive technology also have a significant influence on the charging experience. A maximum charging rate of 400 kW enables customers to add an estimated 175 miles of range in just 10 minutes at an 800V DC charging station. The high-voltage battery can be charged from 10 to 80% capacity in just 21 minutes. Thanks to the battery management tech with integrated switching matrix developed completely in-house by BMW, the new iX3 can also be charged from 400V DC stations. Upgrades to the battery preparation also help to shorten charging times. At home, the new BMW iX3 50 xDrive can charge at up to 19.2 kW when connected the available BMW Wallbox Professional (timing of availability of the BMW Wallbox Professional to be announced closer to US market launch).

Extensive bi-directional charging functionsare also included with every new BMW iX3, meaning that it can be used as an energy source for a variety of applications. The Vehicle-to-Load (V2L) function turns the new BMW iX3 into a mobile powerbank, which can supply electric devices with power while on the move. Vehicle-to-Home (V2H) allows the iX3 to function as a storage unit for solar energy generated by home-fitted photovoltaic systems. And customers can also connect their iX3 to the energy market via the Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G).

The selection of standard-fitted and optional charging accessories has been significantly expanded. For flexible charging during a journey, customers can make use of the standard Multifunction Charger, which comes with several adapters for charging and discharging the high-voltage battery. And BMW Charging offers the option of cost-optimized/solar-power-optimized home charging.

In order to give owners the best possible charging experience, the new BMW iX3 will be fitted as standard with an NACS (North American Charging Standard) compatible charging port. This will provide iX3 owners access to the vast Supercharger network, while a standard CCS (Combined Charging System) adapter will preserve access to other providers from coast to coast, thus ensuring that iX3 owners are never far from a provider no matter where the journey is taking them.

Emblematic of the charging experience in this new vehicle generation is the intelligent charging flap of the new BMW iX3, which uses artificial intelligence (AI) to detect the customer’s intention to connect to a charger and then automatically opens or closes. And sixth-generation BMW eDrive technology makes it possible to view the current charging speed and curve in the My BMW App. Up to ten individual charging contracts from various suppliers can be shown digitally inside the new BMW iX3, enabling use of the Plug & Charge Multi Contract function.

Highly intelligent control center on the high-voltage battery: the Energy Master.

The Energy Master is the control center for the Gen6 electric drivetrain. It is positioned on top of the high-voltage battery and supplies power to the electric motors and the electrical system. It acts as the interface for the high- and low-voltage power supply as well as for data from the high-voltage battery.

In addition, it ensures the battery operates safely and intelligently. Both the hardware and software for the Energy Master were developed in-house at BMW. In-house development of the Energy Master means that innovations can be implemented extremely quickly, which is a major advantage for customers.

New electronics architecture with four “superbrains”.

The completely newly developed electronics architecture comprises a total of four high-performance computers known as “superbrains”. They pool their processing power for driving dynamics, automated driving, infotainment, and basic and comfort-enhancing functions. They also provide the basis for a new software architecture that enables separate development of vehicle and software and creates the foundation for the next-generation Software-Defined Vehicle (SDV). It will be rolled out across the whole of the BMW range in due course, allowing all models to benefit from the same state-of-the-art cyber security and enhanced over-the-air updates complete with tangible AI features.

The new digital nervous system consists of a wiring harness divided into four zones. This reduces weight by 30% compared to the technology used previously and eliminates nearly 2,000 feet of wiring. Another new feature are digital “smart eFuses”, which replace conventional safety fuses. They enable intelligent power modes for different vehicle states that help to improve the iX3’s overall efficiency.

With its four superbrains and highly connected software platforms, the BMW iX3 is a true software-defined vehicle and exceptionally well equipped for the future. Added to which, the new electronics architecture forms the basis for multifaceted improvements in the networking of the BMW iX3 with the My BMW App. This new level of quality when it comes to integration delivers new experiences and holds considerable potential for future innovations.

Heart of Joy: Sheer Driving Pleasure reaches a new level.

One of four superbrains in the electronics architecture of the Neue Klasse, the Heart of Joy looks after drivetrain and driving dynamics management. This high-performance control unit is responsible for the drivetrain, brakes, energy recuperation, and steering functions, and processes information up to ten times faster than conventional control units. In this way, the potential of electric mobility in terms of instantaneous power delivery, smooth power transfer, agility, stability, and efficiency is fully realized.

Together with the BMW Dynamic Performance Control software stack developed fully in-house, the Heart of Joy calculates all the driving dynamics parameters with a new level of speed and precision. The driver and passengers in the new BMW iX3 experience a uniquely harmonious and BMW-typical driving sensation whatever the situation. Every movement of the accelerator, brake pedal, and steering is executed directly and with assurance and precision. Supreme traction and – thanks to the unique Soft Stop function – the smoothest stopping process ever achieved by a BMW are among its other attributes. In addition, the efficiency of the new BMW iX3 is optimized by the integrated management of drivetrain, braking system, and energy recuperation. In everyday driving, 98% of braking maneuvers are carried out using recuperation only, without application of the friction brakes. The only occasions these are called upon are under emergency braking and during extremely sporty driving.

The BMW iX3 can be guided through corners with exceptional accuracy. The Heart of Joy ensures fewer control inputs are required, and the iX3 holds a more precise and stable line. In this way, the BMW iX3 develops consistent, repeatable cornering behavior and can be steered more smoothly and intuitively.

“Superbrain of automated driving” for the driver assistance systems with new-generation technology.

Another high-performance computer brings together all the automated driving and parking functions in the BMW iX3. The central, water-cooled, high-performance computer pools all the functions of the new automated driving systems with 20 times greater processing power than conventional control units. The shy-tech illumination in the newly designed steering wheel signals when functions are available and activates them at the touch of a button: smart, symbiotic and safe.

Active Driving Assistant Plus is fitted as standard in the new BMW iX3. This package of advanced driver assistance systems combines useful functions including Forward Collision Mitigation with Daytime Pedestrian Protection, Active Blind Spot Detection, and Exit Warning. It also includes Adaptive Cruise Control with Stop&Go as well as Steering and Lane Keeping Assistant, which applies corrective steering to help the driver stay centered in the lane even at highway speeds.

Highway Assistant, part of the optional Driving Assistance Professional package, allows the driver to take their hands off the steering wheel for long periods at speeds of up to 85 mph on suitable limited-access highways when weather and traffic conditions permit. However, they must still remain alert and ready to intervene if necessary. Highway Assistant has been enhanced with the addition of Active Lane Change with Eye Activation. If Highway Assistant is engaged and the iX3 approaches slower moving traffic, it can recommend a lane change. To accept the recommendation, the driver need only glance into the appropriate outside rear view mirror. The iX3 will signal and execute the lane change when it is safe to do so.

With the optional Parking Assistant Plus, the BMW iX3 can park itself – parallel or perpendicular – at the touch of a button. The AI-supported parking space recognition function searches for parking spaces of sufficient length and width while driving past. The parking space search function is active at speeds below 22 mph. The driver presses the park button to initiate the automated parking process, which they then only have to monitor. Park Assist also helps the driver exit from spaces, observing the road situation and alerting the driver to approaching vehicles and pedestrians.

BMW Symbiotic Drive provides seamless support.

The BMW iX3 uses its Symbiotic Drive capability combined with driver assistance to create a completely new driving experience. Whenever the driver wants to accelerate, brake, or steer, their inputs merge seamlessly and intuitively with AI-enabled software. This symbiotic driver assistance creates a seamless transition between support for the driver and driver control.

As well as featuring symbiotic steering, the BMW iX3 is also the world’s first model with symbiotic brakes. When this functionality active, the driver is able to apply light steering and braking inputs to adjust the system’s actions as desired at any time, without disengaging the driving assistant as a result. Instead, the function continues to assist the driver. The new approach is demonstrated in how the Lane Departure Warning works: if the system detects that the driver intends to change lane based on their eye movement, it won’t intervene and take corrective action.

The innovative power of the symbiotic brakes is underscored by the more than two dozen patent applications submitted by BMW resulting from the development of these technologies.

Comfort, everyday usability, lightness. Proven chassis technologies, optimized for electric vehicles.

For the first Neue Klasse model, BMW has focused on everyday usability and driving comfort over long journeys as well as shorter trips, combined with a striking degree of lightness. To this end, the BMW iX3 employs proven chassis technologies that bring confidence-inspiring dynamics to the new battery-electric vehicle (BEV) architecture. In everyday use, the sense of connection that creates the feeling of being in a much smaller vehicle makes a compelling impression. In the stop-start conditions of commuter traffic, the BMW iX3 maintains its composed and relaxed demeanor from drive-away to standstill, balancing dynamic flair and comfort with a mastery never before experienced in this class.

The new, slim construction of the high-voltage battery enables a low center of gravity with low roll center height and almost even weight distribution (48.6% front, 51.4% rear). Wide front and rear tracks and a generously long wheelbase improve directional stability and traction. The double-joint spring strut front axle with torque arm and anti-roll bar in the BMW iX3 has its steering gear located ahead of the axle. The kinematics of the front axle were developed with an increased caster offset and firmer rubber mounts to give drivers better steering feel and achieve more precise vehicle response. At the back, a new type of five-link rear axle with separate arrangement of springs and dampers creates space for a larger luggage compartment.

Equipment and individualization to enhance driving pleasure, comfort and versatility.

Elevating the digital experience to a whole new level – in the BMW iX3 and beyond.

The BMW iX3 spearheads a new era for the digital user experience, both in the vehicle and when using the My BMW App. Thanks to the all-new electronics and software architecture featuring four high-performance computers, customers will notice the superior intelligence of the BMW iX3 in everyday situations, too. For example, the interior lighting is automatically switched on when the driver reaches for an object on the front passenger seat, the charging flap opens when approaching it to insert the charging cable, and the My BMW App alerts the customer if the interior sensors detect movements in the vehicle when it is locked. The new electronics and software architecture in the BMW iX3 is already primed for the numerous additional intelligent features that customers are set to benefit from in future thanks to over-the-air software updates.

An engaging experience from start to finish: the BMW iX3 welcomes the driver and says goodbye with a customizable lighting and sound sequence.

BMW Digital Key Plus is set to be the preferred form of vehicle access for the BMW iX3. This means that smartphones and smartwatches from all leading manufacturers (Apple, Samsung, Google, etc.) can be easily set up to work as a vehicle key. Ultra-wideband (UWB) and Bluetooth technology are used to enable smartphone and vehicle to communicate with one another at close range. The UWB technology allows the user’s location to be pinpointed extremely precisely while also ensuring the highest possible vehicle access security. Featuring visual and acoustic effects to accompany the driver as they move from the outside of the BMW iX3 to its interior, the welcome sequence begins while they are approaching the car with the BMW Digital Key Plus. The BMW logo is projected on the ground and the door handles extend automatically just before the driver reaches the car. The iX3 unlocks when they grasp the door handle. While the driver is still settling into their seat, they are welcomed by an animation encompassing the BMW Panoramic Vision and the Central Display that builds harmoniously from the driver’s side to the front passenger side. From approaching the car to driving away in it, the smartphone can simply be left in the driver’s pocket the entire time, with just a press of the brake pedal needed to start the BMW iX3. The BMW Digital Key Plus continues to enrich the seamless digital experience in the BMW iX3 when the journey reaches its end, too. As soon as the driver leaves the vehicle, a lighting sequence provides visual confirmation that the BMW iX3 has been locked automatically.

BMW Maps: intelligent, charging-optimized route planning and comprehensive navigation experience even in base specification.

The new BMW Panoramic iDrive turns every journey into an experience when route guidance is activated. Thoughtful coordination of the navigation information shown in the BMW Panoramic Vision, Central Display, and optional BMW 3D Head-Up Display ensures the driver is given the right information at the right time and in the right place. The Curve Ahead View function provides the driver with visual assistance in the BMW 3D Head-Up Display for challenging bends in the road.

In the BMW iX3, the cloud-based BMW Maps navigation system will calculate a charging-optimized route as soon as the destination has been entered if the vehicle’s current range is insufficient for the journey’s distance. The charging stops are planned so that the selected destination is reached as quickly as possible. The driver can also set a preferred minimum charge level for when the vehicle reaches the final destination or charging stops that can be adjusted in increments of 5%. The system is able to give preference to charging stations operated by selected providers at the driver’s request.

If required, even more detailed information can be provided for the charging station stops en route. Current station availability, supported connector types, and payment options are listed, along with the availability of sanitary, catering, or shopping facilities in the vicinity of the respective charging station. The expected duration of the planned charging stop and the resulting cost can also be shown in advance.

The closer the vehicle gets to a scheduled mid-journey stop, the more frequently the availability of the charging point is checked so that an alternative route can be calculated in good time if necessary. The MAX RANGE function that can be used in the BMW iX3 was mainly developed for situations where a charging point on the intended route is unavailable. The function is available in My Mode Efficient and is able to extend range by up to 25% by carefully limiting drive power and top speed and scaling back comfort functions.

If the BMW Maps navigation system’s route guidance has planned a mid-journey stop at a DC charging point, the high-voltage battery of the BMW iX3 is automatically pre-conditioned prior to arrival in order to ensure it is charged as efficiently as possible. This preparation of the battery can also be initiated manually.

All the details of each completed charging operation are stored in the BMW backend. In this way, the actual charging rate achieved can be precisely documented, for example, and preference given to the best charging stations for the charging-optimized route. Live data from charging station operators on out-of-service charging points is also taken into account for route planning.

BMW Digital Premium: the complete, flexible package of extensive security functions, extended navigation features and unlimited entertainment.

BMW Operating System X has brought about major enhancements to the BMW Digital Premium offering over the preceding generation.

The Onboarding Wizard in the iX3 has undergone a fundamental overhaul in order to offer customers an optimum user experience right from their first encounter with it. Following initial registration with their BMW ID, it guides the customer through the vehicle’s key functions. These include setting up the BMW Digital Key, pairing a smartphone via Bluetooth, and adjusting the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant. The My BMW App allows customers to start personalizing their BMW iX3 before they have even taken delivery of it. Locations such as “Home” or “Work” can be set, for instance, or a profile photo added.

Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration. Wireless use of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto is also included as standard in the new BMW iX3. Any available metadata for media titles or route guidance that are active in the current mode is shown to the driver in the BMW Panoramic Vision and optional BMW 3D Head-Up Display in an intelligently presented form. The QuickSelect widgets continue to be available in the Central Display’s home screen, while the content projected from the smartphone is embedded alongside them so that it fits in with the display’s shape. Once linked, the Apple CarPlay / Android Auto icon will be added to the menu bar, allowing the projected content to be displayed in full screen mode.

Specifications (preliminary – subject to change).

BMW Group in the United States.

BMW of North America, LLC was established 50 years ago to support the sales, marketing and distribution of BMW automobiles and motorcycles in the U.S. In 1993 BMW Group Financial Services NA, LLC was founded, and one year later BMW Manufacturing Co., LLC began assembling vehicles in South Carolina.

Björn Lellmann, Head of Customer Racing at BMW M Motorsport:

"The expectations we had for the debut season of our EVO models were high, but they are currently being exceeded in some areas. This definitely includes the SRO racing series in Europe and North America. In the GT World Challenge Europe, Team WRT is doing a fantastic job – as is Paradine Competition. This top work is reflected in the race results and overall standings. Truly exceptional is the current record of the BMW M4 GT3 EVO in the GT World Challenge America with four wins in six races, as well as in GT America. The BMW M4 GT4 EVO is a guarantee of victory in GT4 America and also achieves successes in the extremely competitive European GT4 series. Congratulations to all teams and drivers! Next weekend, we are preparing our new entry-level car, the BMW M2 Racing, for the 24h Nürburgring at the Qualifiers. Starting in 2026, we will complete our outstanding portfolio of race cars for all categories. I am very proud of how we are currently presenting ourselves as BMW M Motorsport in the customer segment. Let's keep it going."

GT World Challenge Europe: Team WRT leads overall standings.

Team WRT has left its mark on the GT World Challenge Europe powered by AWS season so far. After three race weekends, the Belgian racing team leads all standings – in the Sprint Cup, the Endurance Cup, and the overall ranking from both cups. Last weekend, BMW M works drivers Kelvin van der Linde (RSA) and Charles Weerts (BEL) won the Sunday race of the Sprint Cup at Zandvoort (NED) at the wheel of the #32 BMW M4 GT3 EVO. With their second triumph following the Endurance Cup success at Le Castellet (FRA) together with BMW M works driver Ugo de Wilde (BEL) in April, they have now taken the lead in the Sprint standings in addition to the overall and Endurance standings. This applies to both the driver and team standings.

"It is a pleasure to share the car with Charles," said van der Linde after the Zandvoort victory. "We had a perfect start to the season and are leading the overall standings. I am really proud of the team because we didn't have the fastest car here at Zandvoort." The guarantee of victory on Sunday was a fantastic pit stop by the WRT crew, which brought the car from sixth place to the top. Already on Saturday, van der Linde and Weerts improved from 19th on the grid to fifth place, securing important points. Team WRT deservedly won the Pitstop Challenge. "We know our guys are the best and always bring us back into the game with their fast pit stops," said Weerts.

In the Gold Cup, BMW M works driver Jens Klingmann (GER) and Al Faisal al Zubair (OMA) drove the #777 BMW M4 GT3 EVO from AlManar Racing by WRT to third place twice on the Zandvoort podium. At Brands Hatch (GBR), the two had won the Sunday race. They are in second place in the Gold Cup overall standings. In the Silver Cup, Mex Jansen and Maxime Oosten (both NED) finished second on Sunday at Zandvoort in the #992 BMW M4 GT3 EVO from Paradine Competition. They had achieved the same result on Saturday at Brands Hatch. In the Bronze Cup, BMW M works drivers Augusto Farfus (BRA) and Darren Leung (GBR) finished second in the Saturday race in the Paradine Competition sister car.

GT World Challenge America: BMW M4 GT3 EVO dominates at Sebring.

The BMW M4 GT3 EVO dominated the third race weekend of the GT World Challenge America powered by AWS at Sebring (USA). This was especially true for BMW M works driver Connor De Phillippi and Kenton Koch (both USA), who won both races in the #99 car from Random Vandals Racing and took the lead in the overall standings. Overall, the duo has already won four of the six season races. "It was a fantastic, actually even a dream weekend for Random Vandals Racing," said De Phillippi. "We made no mistakes, the car was great to drive, and we did a perfect job without showing any weaknesses." Koch added: "I am very happy to work with BMW M Motorsport and Random Vandals Racing. I know people say that quickly, but I really mean it. I am in an incredibly good position that many others would surely like to be in." In the second BMW M4 GT3 EVO from Random Vandals Racing, BMW M works driver Bill Auberlen and Varun Choksey (both USA) finished third in the first race in Sebring.

In the Pro-Am category, BMW M works driver Robby Foley and Justin Rothberg (both USA) triumphed with their #29 BMW M4 GT3 EVO from Turner Motorsport in the Sunday race. On Saturday, they had finished third. Thanks to the strong points haul, including the second win of the season, the duo defended the lead in the Pro-Am overall standings.

GT4 America: BMW M Motorsport teams dominate.

BMW M Motorsport dominated GT4 America at Sebring (USA) and celebrated two triple victories. Kevin Boehm and Kenton Koch (both USA) triumphed in both races in the #97 BMW M4 GT4 EVO from Random Vandals Racing, celebrating their second and third wins of the season after winning the second race at Sonoma (USA). Koch thus had a perfect weekend with double victories in GT3 and GT4. Colin Garrett and Zac Anderson (both USA, Auto Technic Racing) completed the Silver-Class podium at Sebring with two third-places, jumping onto the podium for the second and third time after their triumph at the season opener.

Random Vandals Racing also had reason to celebrate in the Pro-Am category. Right behind their teammates Koch and Boehm, Josh Green and Sam Craven (both USA) finished second overall in both races in the #94 BMW M4 GT4 EVO, celebrating two class victories. They had already left the Pro-Am competition behind in the second race at Sonoma, while their brand colleagues James Walker Jr. and Tyler McQuarrie (both USA, BimmerWorld) were unbeatable at Austin (USA).

In the Am category, James Clay and Charlie Postins (both USA) from Team BimmerWorld won both races at the Sebring International Raceway, celebrating their second and third wins of the season and completing the double triple-victory for BMW M Motorsport in Florida.

GT America: Rothberg defends overall lead.

Justin Rothberg (USA) defended his lead in GT America at the fourth race weekend at Sebring (USA). At the Sebring International Raceway, the American drove his #29 BMW M4 GT3 EVO from Turner Motorsport to second and third places. Rothberg, who had already celebrated his third win of the season at Austin (USA) at the end of April, has been on the podium in the past seven races – and continues to lead the overall standings in GT America at the season's halfway point.

GT4 European Series: Leandri and de Barn win again at Zandvoort.

At the second race weekend of the GT4 European Series at Zandvoort (NED), Jean-Mathieu Leandri and Antoni de Barn (both FRA) confirmed their outstanding form in the Am category. After two class wins at the season opener at Le Castellet (FRA), the duo from Team CHAZEL Technologie Course in the #317 BMW M4 GT4 EVO had to settle for second place in a close duel in the first race. In the second race, however, Leandri and de Barn were once again unbeatable, celebrating their third win in the fourth race of the season and confidently defending the overall lead in the Am category.

In the Silver Class, BMW M Motorsport had to settle for two fourth places on the Circuit Zandvoort after two podiums at the season start. Benjamin Lessennes (BEL) and Ricardo van der Ende (NED) from Team L'Espace Bienvenue, who had finished third at Le Castellet, worked their way from ninth on the grid to fourth place in the first race in the #17 BMW M4 GT4 EVO. In the second race, Berkay Besler (TUR) and Gabriele Piana (ITA) from Team Borusan Otomotiv Motorsport narrowly missed the podium. At Le Castellet, their teammates Pedro Ebrahim (BRA) and Yagiz Gedik (TUR) had also finished third on the podium in the Silver Class.

GT Cup Series: Wins and podiums at the Red Bull Ring.

The GT Cup Series started the 2025 season at the Red Bull Ring (AUT) over the weekend. On the programme was an endurance race on Saturday and two sprint races on Sunday. The BMW M Motorsport teams collected wins and podiums.

In the one-hour endurance race, with mandatory pit stops and driver changes, second and third places on the overall podium went to crews with the BMW M4 GT3. Jürgen Alzen and Timo Scheibner (both GER / H&R Spezialfedern) finished second, directly followed by Rudolf Beňo and Richard Gonda (both SVK / Aries Racing). These pairings also each won their class in categories 6+8 and GT3.

Two wins for Team H&R Spezialfedern came in the two sprint races on Sunday. Alzen won the first race, and his teammate Scheibner took the top step of the podium in the second race. Beňo finished fourth and secured the GT3 class win.

BMW M works driver Max Hesse (GER) was also at Spielberg. He supported Team Racing Trevor, which fielded a BMW M4 GT3 EVO, and shared the cockpit with Antal Szigo. The duo retired early from the endurance race. In the sprint races, Szigo and Hesse each finished second in the GT3 class.

China GT Championship: Four wins in four races for the BMW M4 GT3 EVO.

BMW M Motorsport also impressed at the second race weekend of the China GT Championship. Erik Johansson (SWE) and Huang Ruohan (CHN) won both races in the #90 BMW M4 GT3 EVO at the Shanghai International Circuit (CHN), continuing the winning streak of the FIST Team AAI. At the season opener three weeks earlier, Johansson and Yu Lin (CHN) had already won both races at Shanghai. Johansson took sole leadership in the driver standings of the China GT Championship after his fourth win in four races.

# Once again Euro NCAP Top Rating: 5 Stars for the fully electric MINI Cooper.
## The current MINI Cooper Electric models offer maximum safety. This is the result of the latest Euro NCAP crash tests, in which the European Consumer Protection Institute awarded all fully electric MINI Cooper models the top rating. MINI Cooper E, MINI Cooper SE and MINI Cooper JCW E impressed with both passive and active safety.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Munich. The aim of the Euro NCAP tests is to continuously increase vehicle safety. Both vehicle occupants and other road users should be exposed to an ever-decreasing risk of injury. The long-term intention: "Vision Zero" - that is, zero road fatalities in Europe. Accordingly, the requirements in the tests become stricter year after year. The criteria for the protection of pedestrians and cyclists have been tightened, and the test scenarios for both passive and active safety have been expanded.

A top rating of 5 stars is not common in the segment of fully electric MINI Cooper models. Particularly new vehicles in this category often come up short due to price sensitivity - accordingly, the top rating is awarded rather rarely.

The Euro NCAP (European New Car Assessment Programme) ratings are a Europe-wide recognised standard for accident safety and are constantly being adapted. They provide a quickly comprehensible comparison of the safety features of a new vehicle. The award of the top rating of 5 stars is exclusively given to new vehicles that provide excellent impact protection and, in addition, a good range of comprehensive and practical technology for accident avoidance.

Excellent: Top rating from Euro NCAP for the electric MINI Cooper models. The electrically powered MINI Cooper models impress with their performance, the comfortable spaciousness despite compact dimensions, and the new minimalist design. Thanks to the fully electric drivetrain, the legendary go-kart feeling, and the now certified high level of safety, the fifth generation of the charismatic three-door model is perfectly equipped for the demands of today's urban mobility. The combination of sheer driving fun and a high level of safety underscores the exceptional position of the MINI Cooper Electric models in their segment and at the same time the premium claim of the brand.

In addition to passive and active safety, the top rating in the current Euro NCAP test is also due to effective protection for pedestrians and cyclists, as well as effective systems for accident avoidance. New is the standard pelvic belt pretensioner in all fully electric MINI Cooper models, too.

In the four major safety areas, the MINI models achieve top values for their segment. In terms of occupant protection , the three-door model achieves a safety compliance rate of 89% - a value that is usually reserved for larger vehicle classes.

This also applies to the 87% in child safety and the 79% in safety assistants . [ADDRESS]% in pedestrian protection a very high level of safety I also achieved for compact cars.

The extensive standard equipment with safety-relevant driver assistance systems also plays a decisive role in the top ratings. The passive safety has been further developed in the form of an integrated safety concept.

As early as December 2024, the new MINI Countryman achieved the top rating of 5 stars, underscoring the brand's claim not only to produce extremely attractive, but also particularly safe vehicles.

# BMW NA 50th Anniversary | 50 Stories for 50 Years [ADDRESS]: “A BMW Motorcycle built for America: The R 1200 C”.
## In the mid-1990s, Harley-Davidson’s laid-back V-twins were among the most popular motorcycles in America, inspiring countless imitators from Japanese and Italian manufacturers. Even sport-oriented Ducati got into the cruiser act, after which it was only a matter of time before BMW did the same.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the mid-1990s, Harley-Davidson’s laid-back V-twins were among the most popular motorcycles in America, inspiring countless imitators from Japanese and Italian manufacturers. Even sport-oriented Ducati got into the cruiser act, after which it was only a matter of time before BMW did the same.

“The cruiser segment was doing so well, and it kept growing, especially in the U.S.,” said Phil Capossela, Vice-President of BMW of North America’s motorcycle division since August 1991. “We asked if BMW could do something that would be competitive, and BMW Motorrad was open to it.”

Rather than build a Harley clone, BMW created a cruiser with a distinctly Bavarian twist. Where other cruisers were defined by their V-twin engines, BMW featured Munich’s traditional boxer twin, here surrounded by an innovative design created under the leadership of American native David Robb.

As BMW’s first designer to work exclusively on the motorcycle side, Robb had been tasked by BMW Group Design Chief Chris Bangle with modernizing BMW’s two-wheelers. As part of that process, Robb wanted to liberate the company’s designers to explore new niches beyond the familiar touring and GS categories.

“The talent was there,” Robb said. “In the past, that talent wasn’t always given the opportunity to push the boundaries.”

The cruiser project would allow BMW designers to do exactly that. It began at Designworks/USA in Southern California, where Richard Kong sketched a bike that was refined for production by BMW Design’s Dietmar Finger. Finger, in turn, supervised the creation of a styling model by Stefano Ardagna and Saverio Spadone at Studio Torino in Italy.

Where an automobile cloaks its mechanical elements in a sheet-metal skin, a motorcycle often leaves those elements exposed, emphasizing its raw functionality. BMW’s cruiser made the most of that design opportunity, using a bespoke frame with a cast aluminum front section that was as much sculpture as structure. An all-new Telelever front suspension employed the rakish geometry typical of a cruiser, here executed in bright aluminum. “We said, ‘Let’s not hide the function of the Telelever,’ and it became a work of art,” Robb said.

The then-current Paralever rear suspension wouldn’t work, so the designers reverted to the older Monolever design, lengthened by more than three inches and with a reinforced tube to contain the driveshaft. The single-sided Monolever set the cruiser even further apart from its competition, giving its left side a minimal appearance in which the rear shock was clearly visible along with the suspension linkage.

That was a nice retro touch, as were the swept-back handlebars, polished valve covers, stubby exhaust pipes, spoked wheels, a deeply valanced rear fender, solo saddle with passenger pad, chrome headlight, and gauges mounted on the triple clamps. Following the Harley model, BMW offered a wide range of customization options that increased the bike’s versatility, enhancing its touring capabilities or altering its appearance to suit its owner’s preferences.

In the midst of those unfamiliar design flourishes, BMW’s traditional boxer engine gave the cruiser an unmistakable Bavarian identity. [ADDRESS],170cc of displacement, the A63 engine was BMW’s largest oil-head boxer, and it would be available exclusively in the bike designated as the R 1200 C for the duration of its production run.

With its fuel injection system hidden behind nicely detailed panels, the A63 delivered 61 horsepower at 5,000 rpm and 72 pound-feet at 3,000 rpm. Its torque-biased output was a clear shot across Harley’s bow, as well as a nod to the R 1200 C’s mission as a bike for relaxed travel over moderate distances rather than high-speed canyon carving or cross-country adventures. As such, the bike drew criticism from BMW’s traditional clientele, who questioned its authenticity after its launch in 1997.

“We’d never had such a thing, so there were questions whether this was really a BMW,” Capossela said. “But once people started riding it, they did embrace it, and so did the dealers, who were getting a totally new product in a totally new segment.”

Just as the R 1200 C was arriving in dealerships, it received valuable exposure as the second BMW to appear in a James Bond film. Thanks to a product-placement agreement negotiated by Tom McGurn of BMW’s Corporate Communications department, James Bond had driven a pre-production Z3 roadster in 1995’s GoldenEye . It was set to be followed by another BMW sports car, but the company had nothing suitable in the pipeline when the Bond producers arrived in Munich in the fall of 1996. Perhaps a motorcycle would do?

“I presented this still-new bike, the R 1200 C, which wouldn’t be released until the fall of ’97,” Robb said. “Polite compliments about the bike and the presentation were exchanged. After that, plus the narrative that their film had no motorcycles in it, they flew back to Southern California.

“A week before Christmas, our marketing department got a call from Hollywood. The company would like six of the motorcycles early next April, plus a fleet of BMWs and Range Rovers. They had rewritten the script around the bike, and now we had to knock out half a dozen of these motorcycles by hand!”

Tomorrow Never Dies premiered on [ADDRESS], 1997. The film put Pierce Brosnan and Michelle Yeoh, hand-cuffed together, in command of the R 1200 C for a chase scene. That gave the bike a big promotional boost shortly after its launch, and later that year the Guggenheim Museum included the R 1200 C in its The Art of the Motorcycle exhibit.

The R 1200 C had broken the mold for what a BMW motorcycle could be, it brought in new customers to the brand and added significantly to BMW Motorrad’s volume in the USA. From 1997 to 2004, BMW sold a total of 40,218 examples, most of which were sold in North America.

“I thought that number was pretty good, and developing a totally different motorcycle was a good step to take,” Capossela said. “I think the Harley people were laughing at first, but then they weren’t. They realized it was a pretty damn good motorcycle.”

The R 1200 C had no direct successor, but in 2020 BMW re-entered the cruiser segment with the retro-style R 18. Like the R 1200 C, it used BMW’s largest-displacement air/oil-cooled engine, this time a massive 1,802cc boxer twin. Its distinctive styling—by a team led by Ola Stenegard, working under Motorrad design chief Edgar Heinrich—took inspiration from the R 5 that had revolutionized BMW in 1936. Like the R 5, the R 18 used a frame made of steel tubes of varying thicknesses, mated to a swingarm that mimicked the look of a hardtail. The driveshaft was plated in nickel and left fully exposed just like BMW’s traditional bikes from Munich. At the front, the R 18 eschewed the Telelever in favor of traditional telescopic forks like those pioneered on the R 5. Spoked wheels and a single round headlight completed the vintage look, the latter with modern LED technology and optional adaptive turning. Other contemporary features included keyless operation and three riding modes—Rain, Roll, and Rock—for throttle and traction control.

The R 18 launched in the middle of the Covid pandemic, a difficult time for vehicle sales worldwide, yet it helped BMW record its second-best sales year to date in 2020. BMW Motorrad delivered 169,272 motorcycles to customers that year, about half of which were boxer-engine bikes including the R 18. Now offered in three model variants, the R 18 helped Motorrad sell 209,257 motorcycles in 2024, a record number in its 101 st year of producing 2-wheeled BMWs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Richmond Hill, ON. BMW presents the first series-production Neue Klasse model. The BMW iX3 is a fully electric Sports Activity Vehicle (SAV) that gives customers their first on-the-road taste of a whole new era of The Ultimate Driving Machine. An all-new design language gives the iX3 a character-rich appearance that faithfully conveys the technological progress made by the new model. With sixth-generation BMW eDrive technology, a range of up to 650 km (estimated range according to preliminary BMW AG tests based on the EPA’s test procedure standards) and a peak DC charging rate of 400 kW, the new BMW iX3 sets new standards for efficiency and long-distance capability. A new electronics and software architecture including four “superbrain” high-performance computers makes the first Neue Klasse model more intelligent and better equipped for the future than ever. The “Heart of Joy” drivetrain and driving dynamics management technology enables unmatched poise, assurance, and precision, while the latest systems for automated driving optimize symbiotic human-vehicle interaction.

A defining element of the digital user experience in the new BMW iX3 is the BMW Panoramic iDrive, which elevates intuitive operation and the driver focus to a new level. And an all-encompassing sustainability concept reduces the iX3’s product carbon footprint over its lifecycle by more than 30% compared to previous electric BMW models.

The first Neue Klasse model will be built at the newly constructed BMW Group plant in Debrecen, Hungary. The first variant of the fully electric SAV to roll off the production line will be the BMW iX3 50 xDrive with an output of 463 hp and dual-motor all-wheel drive. Further fully electric variants will follow. The market launch of the new BMW iX3 will commence in Canada in the summer of 2026.

The new BMW iX3 represents a leap forward in development and a milestone in the transformation process when it comes to electrification, digitalization, and circularity. Spearheading the arrival of the Neue Klasse, the iX3 offers customers the latest design and technology innovations, which will shape the brand’s entire model range moving forward. The technologies introduced in the Neue Klasse will be incorporated into nearly 40 new models and model updates between now and 2027.

“The Neue Klasse is our biggest future-focused project and marks a huge leap forward in terms of technologies, driving experience, and design,” says [EXECUTIVE_OFFICER], Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG. “Practically everything about it is new, yet it is also more BMW than ever. Our whole product range will benefit from the innovations brought by the Neue Klasse – whichever drive system technology is employed. What started as a bold vision has now become reality: the BMW iX3 is the first Neue Klasse model to go into series production, kicking off a new era for BMW.”

Launch of the new design language: reduced, characterful, and timeless.

The new BMW iX3 will launch the new BMW design language, which will expand across the whole of BMW’s range as new models and variants are introduced. This new use of forms provides a very modern interpretation of BMW’s original and enduring blueprint. For this reason, comprehensive design protection has been registered for the new BMW design language used in the new BMW iX3.

“The design of the Neue Klasse provides a very modern interpretation of what BMW has always stood for,” says Adrian van Hooydonk, Head of BMW Group Design. “With our new design language, the new BMW iX3 looks future-focused, modern, and timeless – but, above all, more BMW than ever.”

[ADDRESS],782 mm long, 1,895 mm wide, and 1,646 mm tall, the new BMW iX3 has the hallmark proportions of a BMW SAV. The characteristic two-box design is infused with the authoritative presence of a BMW X model and has a reduced surface treatment that emphasizes all four wheels. Created squarely and exclusively for electric vehicles, the vehicle architecture enables an extremely favorable ratio of exterior size to interior space. The BMW iX3 has a 2,897 mm wheelbase and track widths of 1,628 mm at the front axle and 1,633 mm at the rear.

The front end: new interpretation of the classic four-eyed face.

The upright front end gives the new BMW iX3 a commanding presence. Large air intakes and a black band in the lower section of the front apron accentuate the robust sportiness of this BMW X model. Added to which, the reduced surface treatment allows the distinctive BMW kidneys and twin headlights to take centre stage. An all-new horizontal light signature takes the place of chrome trim elements, lending the front end a sense of quality and sophistication. The redesigned BMW roundel is embedded above the kidneys in the “valley” of the hood.

Evocative of iconic Neue Klasse vehicles of the 60s and 70s such as the 1600 and 2002, the sculpted BMW kidneys are vertically arranged. Embedding the kidneys into the surface of the front apron emphasizes their contours further still. There is also a new take on the signature BMW four-eyed face created by the headlights. Here, vertical, slightly outward-slanting daytime driving light elements with indicator functions produce the unwavering gaze on the road familiar from BMW’s past. Additional horizontal light surfaces, which create a distinct sense of depth and extend up to the BMW kidneys, add the finishing touches to the new light signature. Together with the optional illuminated BMW kidneys, they bring a unique lighting effect to the front of the new BMW iX3.

Side view combines powerful stature with lightness.

In the vehicle’s flanks, generously proportioned surfaces accentuated by a small number of precise lines create a character-rich appearance. The design appears as if cut from a single mold thanks to flowing transitions into the front and rear ends. The muscular stature of the new BMW iX3 is underscored by body-coloured wheel arches and subtly rectangular contours. In contrast, the glazed areas in the upper section of the vehicle body exude an elegant sense of lightness. The slim side windows and slightly downward-sloping roofline optimize aerodynamics. Hidden seals allow the vehicle body to transition directly into the glass surfaces, producing a harmonious side view. A character line positioned low down in the flanks emphasizes the height of the iX3 and suggests a dynamically stretched profile. The door handles are integrated flush into the doors and extend automatically when the BMW Digital Key or traditional key fob approaches.

[ADDRESS]-inch alloy wheels fitted as standard underscore the SAV’s powerful appearance. Painstaking aerodynamic optimization enables a drag coefficient (C d ) of 0.24.

Rear end with athletic shoulders and a new light signature.

The clear design language, focusing on the essentials, continues at the rear of the new BMW iX3. As at the front, the dominant theme in the upper section of the rear is large surfaces detailed by a small number of lines, creating a technical, modern aesthetic. The lower section of the rear apron, meanwhile, generates greater visual impact, with the robust yet sporting character of the new BMW iX3 underscored by a black band and a diffuser element.

When viewed from the rear, the eye is drawn to the athletic shoulders of the body and the heavily tapered – and therefore aerodynamic – greenhouse. The visual emphasis of the wheel arches accentuates the iX3’s width and robust stance on the road. This effect is enhanced by the expansive, horizontally arranged rear lights. The BMW iX3 also has a new light signature at the rear. Its light sources are split through several levels and develop a vivid sense of depth. The individual light sources of the rear lights on the new iX3 are arranged in the familiar BMW “L” shape.

The standard roof spoiler further raises the visual dynamism of the new BMW iX3. Echoing the “valley” in the front hood, the spoiler has a central recess that continues into the space between the rear lights, where it creates a perfect stage for the updated BMW logo.

Interior design: modern space has a BMW-typical driver focus and offers exceptional comfort for all passengers.

The design of the BMW iX3 interior sets new standards in terms of modernity and digital experience. The interior has an uncluttered, reduced design, providing the ideal stage for the digital experience. The cabin is all about a clear driver focus and comfort for all those on board. Created specifically for electric vehicles, the vehicle architecture allows for generous levels of space in all five seats. The lines of the “floating” instrument panel flow directly into the large door trim panels, creating an enveloping wrap-around effect for the passengers. With its textile surface, the instrument panel – with atmospheric backlighting – contributes to the warm and inviting atmosphere inside. Large window surfaces and the optional Panoramic Roof with Climate Glass create an ambience bathed in light.

Another prominent influence in the horizontally arranged cockpit is the new BMW Panoramic iDrive, which is based on the likewise newly developed BMW Operating System X. It brings together displays, geometry, and light and sound design into a holistic experience, customizable via My Modes. Also contributing to the prevailing atmosphere are the new driving sounds, sound effects, and sound signals of the BMW HypersonX soundscape created specifically for the Neue Klasse.

Newly designed seats in a choice of interior colours and materials.

The newly designed seats in the new BMW iX3 offer high levels of comfort over long distances, firm lateral support, and a wide range of adjustment. Thick seat cushions extending downward and the absence, to a large extent, of plastic trim give the seats an elegant appearance. With their distinctive contours, the head restraints also contribute to the progressive style of the interior design.

As standard, the seats are upholstered in perforated Veganza in Black, Digital White, or Castanea. Optionally, customers may also select Black BMW Individual Merino Leather.

In the front section of the centre console is a storage space with a wireless device charging pad, two USB-C ports, and two cup holders separated by an illuminated triangular trim element. Behind it are the gear selector, a roller switch for adjusting the audio system volume, and the physical buttons for the parking brake, rear window heating, windshield defrosting, and hazard warning lights. Below the centre console, a storage space with indirect illumination offers additional room for stowing items.

The substantial luggage compartment capacity of the new BMW iX3 can be increased by folding down the rear seats as required. An additional storage compartment under the front hood is available for smaller items. Customers needing additional capacity can specify the optional trailer hitch with a towing capacity of up to 2,000 kg.

BMW Panoramic iDrive. Four elements with a single goal: complete driver focus. The BMW iX3 is the first series-production model in which BMW Panoramic iDrive redefines the user experience. With its neatly judged balance between digital functions and physical elements, BMW Panoramic iDrive elevates intuitive operation – according to BMW’s “hands on the wheel, eyes on the road” principle – to a new level of driver focus. The entire system – consisting of the BMW Panoramic Vision, the multifunction steering wheel, the Central Display, and the optional BMW 3D Head-Up Display – is born out of decades of experience and a user-centric design approach. Individual customer feedback, data from over 10 million connected vehicles, and usability studies with more than 3,000 customers were all incorporated into the development process. Physical controls are on hand for the windshield wipers, turn signal indicators, exterior mirrors, volume control, gear selector, parking brake, hazard warning lights, rear window heating, and defrost function. Other functions have been optimized for use by touch and voice command or via the multifunction steering wheel.

The BMW Panoramic Vision is a newly developed display concept from BMW for projecting content directly onto the lower section of the windshield, where information appears on a black printed surface stretching from A-pillar to A-pillar. The information is visible to all occupants and promises a new dimension in driver focus. The most important driving information is projected directly into the driver’s line of sight on the left-hand side of the BMW Panoramic Vision, above the steering wheel. The driver is able to personalize content in the central and right-hand areas of the BMW Panoramic Vision via the Central Display. The way the BMW Panoramic Vision is integrated creates a 3D effect for the driver and passengers.

The new optional BMW 3D Head-Up Display positioned above the BMW Panoramic Vision now shows integrated navigation and automated driving graphics in the driver’s immediate field of vision. The content in the BMW Panoramic Vision and BMW 3D Head-Up Display is presented in a neatly coordinated way. BMW has filed several patent applications resulting from the development of the projection technologies used in the two displays, underlining just how much innovation has gone into them.

[ADDRESS].9-inch Central Display with matrix backlight technology features a further improved version of the familiar QuickSelect menu structure to enable optimum operation of functions and content by touch. The Central Display’s home screen continuously shows the BMW Maps navigation system’s map view or other individually configurable content. Also to be found on this level are vertically arranged widgets on the driver’s side, which the user can switch between by swiping. The QuickSelect feature allows important functions to be accessed directly without having to enter a submenu. Swiping a widget horizontally then displays additional related information and settings options. Operation is highly ergonomic thanks to the Central Display’s shape and positioning in close proximity to the steering wheel. Users can return to the home screen from any of the submenus with a tap of the finger on the home icon at the lower edge of the Central Display. Quick access icons for music, navigation, phone calls, the All Apps menu, and the vehicle settings menu are also located here. There is also a menu on the Central Display containing widgets that can be moved to the BMW Panoramic Vision by drag and drop. Up to six widgets can be configured in this way.

The new multifunction steering wheel employs BMW’s shy-tech approach, meaning available functions are indicated by illuminating the corresponding buttons. It thereby serves as the primary physical control point, whose buttons provide active haptic feedback. The buttons’ finely designed, relief-like surfaces provide optimum orientation and enable the driver to control functions manually without needing to take their eyes off the road. The buttons have been arranged in accordance with the customary principle of placing driving assistance functions on the left side of the steering wheel and functions for controlling infotainment and communications features on the right.

BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant with major improvements for natural interaction. The BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant plays a key role in the BMW iX3 operating concept, serving as an adaptive assistant that turns the iX3 into an intelligent digital companion. Besides the addition of two new voices, its appearance has also been completely redesigned for the BMW Panoramic Vision. The assistant can be summoned in the usual way with the prompt “Hey BMW” or the push of a button on the steering wheel’s right-hand control panel. The Intelligent Personal Assistant is positioned in the centre of the BMW Panoramic Vision by default following initial setup. It is able to react appropriately to the specific context with a range of engaging, lively animations. Following prolonged periods of inactivity, the assistant recedes into the background on a visual level by transforming into the BMW logo. The assistant can control the windows, air conditioning, seating comfort, phone calls, in-car entertainment, and more. It can also be used to call up many function menus or operate certain apps.

If the driver so chooses, the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant is also able to offer proactive suggestions based on usage patterns and other factors. BMW Operating System X further expands this intelligent capability by taking far more contexts into account, e.g. from the environmental situation. In the case of driver assistance systems that are fitted but seldom used, for instance, the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant will point them out to the driver in suitable situations. If the vehicle is being driven in a sporty manner on entertaining stretches of road, the assistant will propose activating My Mode Sport. And if the driver misses a call, the assistant will suggest returning the call in the widget on the Central Display. If the driver doesn’t react to the proactive prompts repeatedly or if individual suggestions are frequently rejected, the intelligent system will take note of this and refrain from making suggestions in future.

The Routines function further expands the ways in which the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant can help the driver. In the same way people have their daily morning routine of, say, first switching on the coffee maker then scrolling through the day’s news, drivers are now able to easily teach the assistant routines for the ultimate in personal driving pleasure. If the steering wheel heating, seat heating, and defrost function are all switched on at the start of every journey in winter, for instance, these same actions can be simply combined into a routine.

Additional functions will be provided to customers in future via software updates in order to keep improving and expanding the capabilities of the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant.

Underpinning BMW Panoramic iDrive is the newly developed BMW Operating System X, which offers extensive scope for personalization via the BMW ID, intelligent driver assistance, a wide variety of digital functions, extensive connectivity using the My BMW App, and outstanding future-proofing thanks to BMW Software Updates.

Sixth-generation BMW eDrive technology: higher efficiency, more range, faster charging.

The sixth-generation BMW eDrive technology developed for the Neue Klasse comprises highly efficient electric motors, fundamentally new high-voltage batteries with cylindrical cells, and 800V technology. The BMW iX3 50 xDrive is powered by two electric motors which generate a combined output of 463 hp and 476 lb-ft of torque, enabling a trip from 0-100 km/h in an estimated 4.9 seconds and a top speed of 210 km/h. Its electric all-wheel-drive configuration consists of an extensively upgraded and highly efficient Electrically Excited Synchronous Motor (EESM) at the rear axle and a new Asynchronous Motor (ASM) at the front. The combination of EESM and ASM is evidence of BMW’s commitment to technological openness within electric mobility. The drive technology developed for the Neue Klasse reduces energy losses by 40% compared to fifth-generation BMW eDrive technology, weight by 10%, and manufacturing costs by 20%.

In the Electrically Excited Synchronous Motor (EESM) at the rear axle, the rotor’s magnetic field is generated by an excitation current from an external source rather than permanent magnets. As with the Gen5 version, this synchronous motor features a compact housing incorporating the electric drive unit, power electronics and transmission. Unlike the Gen5 drivetrain, Gen6 employs a second electric motor technology in the form of an Asynchronous Motor (ASM). The ASM at the front axle works on the principle of induction, so neither permanent magnets nor an external excitation current are required.

The new high-voltage battery concept with lithium-ion cylindrical cells for the Neue Klasse also achieves significant advances. The energy density on a cell level is 20% higher than with fifth-generation BMW eDrive technology, and also enables a 30% increase in charging speed. The cylindrical cells are integrated directly into the high-voltage battery (“cell to pack”), which benefits energy density and cost efficiency. Added to which, the high-voltage battery is integrated into the vehicle architecture as a structural component to minimize weight (“pack to open body”). The high-voltage battery in the BMW iX3 50 xDrive enables a range of up to 650 km (estimated range according to preliminary BMW AG tests based on the EPA’s test procedure standards).

BMW Charging: short charging times, premiere of bi-directional charging.

The advances brought by sixth-generation BMW eDrive technology also have a significant influence on the charging experience. A maximum charging rate of 400 kW enables users to charge from 10 to 80% capacity in just 21 minutes at an 800V DC charging station. Thanks to the battery management tech with integrated switching matrix developed completely in-house by BMW, the new iX3 can also be charged from 400V DC stations. Upgrades to the battery preparation also help to shorten charging times. At home, the new BMW iX3 50 xDrive can charge at up to 19.2 kW when connected to the available BMW Wallbox Professional (timing of availability of the BMW Wallbox Professional to be announced closer to Canadian market launch).

Bidirectional charging functionsare also included with every new BMW iX3, meaning that it can be used as an energy source for a variety of applications. The Vehicle-to-Load (V2L) function turns the new BMW iX3 into a mobile powerbank, which can supply electric devices with power. Vehicle-to-Home (V2H) allows the iX3 to function as a back up emergency power supply in the event of an outage. The ability to use the iX3 as a storage unit for solar energy generated by home-fitted photovoltaic systems will become available in the future. And customers will also be able to connect their iX3 to the energy market via the Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) at a later stage.

The selection of standard-fitted and optional charging accessories has been significantly expanded. For flexible charging during a journey, customers can make use of the Multifunction Charger, which comes with several adapters for charging the high-voltage battery.

In order to give owners the best possible charging experience, the new BMW iX3 will be fitted as standard with an NACS (North American Charging Standard) compatible charging port. This will provide iX3 owners access to the vast Supercharger network, while a standard CCS (Combined Charging System) adapter will preserve access to other providers from coast to coast, thus ensuring that iX3 owners are never far from a provider no matter where the journey is taking them.

Emblematic of the charging experience in this new vehicle generation is the intelligent charging flap of the new BMW iX3, which uses artificial intelligence (AI) to detect the customer’s intention to connect to a charger and then automatically opens or closes. And sixth-generation BMW eDrive technology makes it possible to view the current charging speed and curve in the My BMW App. Up to ten individual charging contracts from various suppliers can be shown digitally inside the new BMW iX3, enabling use of the Plug & Charge Multi Contract function.

Highly intelligent control centre on the high-voltage battery: the Energy Master.

The Energy Master is the control centre for the Gen6 electric drivetrain. It is positioned on top of the high-voltage battery and supplies power to the electric motors and the electrical system. It acts as the interface for the high- and low-voltage power supply as well as for data from the high-voltage battery.

In addition, it ensures the battery operates safely and intelligently. Both the hardware and software for the Energy Master were developed in-house at BMW. In-house development of the Energy Master means that innovations can be implemented extremely quickly, which is a major advantage for customers.

New electronics architecture with four “superbrains”.

The completely newly developed electronics architecture comprises a total of four high-performance computers known as “superbrains”. They pool their processing power for driving dynamics, automated driving, infotainment, and basic and comfort-enhancing functions. They also provide the basis for a new software architecture that enables separate development of vehicle and software and creates the foundation for the next-generation Software-Defined Vehicle (SDV). It will be rolled out across the whole of the BMW range in due course, allowing all models to benefit from the same state-of-the-art cyber security and enhanced over-the-air updates complete with tangible AI features.

The new digital nervous system consists of a wiring harness divided into four zones. This reduces weight by 30% compared to the technology used previously and eliminates approximately 600 metres of wiring. Another new feature are digital “smart eFuses”, which replace conventional safety fuses. They enable intelligent power modes for different vehicle states that help to improve the iX3’s overall efficiency.

With its four superbrains and highly connected software platforms, the BMW iX3 is a true software-defined vehicle and exceptionally well equipped for the future. Added to which, the new electronics architecture forms the basis for multifaceted improvements in the networking of the BMW iX3 with the My BMW App. This new level of quality when it comes to integration delivers new experiences and holds considerable potential for future innovations.

Heart of Joy: Sheer Driving Pleasure reaches a new level.

One of four superbrains in the electronics architecture of the Neue Klasse, the Heart of Joy looks after drivetrain and driving dynamics management. This high-performance control unit is responsible for the drivetrain, brakes, energy recuperation, and steering functions, and processes information up to ten times faster than conventional control units. In this way, the potential of electric mobility in terms of instantaneous power delivery, smooth power transfer, agility, stability, and efficiency is fully realized.

Together with the BMW Dynamic Performance Control software stack developed fully in-house, the Heart of Joy calculates all the driving dynamics parameters with a new level of speed and precision. The driver and passengers in the new BMW iX3 experience a uniquely harmonious and BMW-typical driving sensation whatever the situation. Every movement of the accelerator, brake pedal, and steering is executed directly and with assurance and precision. Supreme traction and – thanks to the unique Soft Stop function – the smoothest stopping process ever achieved by a BMW are among its other attributes. In addition, the efficiency of the new BMW iX3 is optimized by the integrated management of drivetrain, braking system, and energy recuperation. In everyday driving, 98% of braking maneuvers are carried out using recuperation only, without application of the friction brakes. The only occasions these are called upon are under emergency braking and during extremely sporty driving.

The BMW iX3 can be guided through corners with exceptional accuracy. The Heart of Joy ensures fewer control inputs are required, and the iX3 holds a more precise and stable line. In this way, the BMW iX3 develops consistent, repeatable cornering behavior and can be steered more smoothly and intuitively.

“Superbrain of automated driving” for the driver assistance systems with new-generation technology.

Another high-performance computer brings together all the automated driving and parking functions in the BMW iX3. The central, water-cooled, high-performance computer pools all the functions of the new automated driving systems with 20 times greater processing power than conventional control units. The shy-tech illumination in the newly designed steering wheel signals when functions are available and activates them at the touch of a button: smart, symbiotic and safe.

Driving Assistant is fitted as standard in the new BMW iX3. This includes useful functions such as Forward Collision Mitigation with Daytime Pedestrian Protection, Active Blind Spot Warning, Lane Departure Warning with Steering Intervention and Exit Warning. Driving Assistant Plus is optionally available and includes Active Cruise Control with Stop & Go, as well as Steering and Lane Control, which applies corrective steering to help the driver stay centred in the lane even at highway speeds.

Highway Assistant is additionally available as optional equipment, which allows the driver to take their hands off the steering wheel for long periods at speeds of up to 130 km/h on suitable limited-access highways when weather and traffic conditions permit. However, they must still remain alert and ready to intervene if necessary. Highway Assistant has been enhanced with the addition of Active Lane Change with Eye Activation. If Highway Assistant is engaged and the iX3 approaches slower moving traffic, it can recommend a lane change. To accept the recommendation, the driver need only glance into the appropriate side mirror. The iX3 will signal and execute the lane change when it is safe to do so.

With the standardParking Assistant, the BMW iX3 can park itself – parallel or perpendicular – at the touch of a button. The AI-supported parking space recognition function searches for parking spaces of sufficient length and width while driving past. The parking space search function is active at speeds below 35 km/h. The driver presses the park button to initiate the automated parking process, which they then only have to monitor. Park Assist also helps the driver exit from spaces, observing the road situation and alerting the driver to approaching vehicles and pedestrians.

BMW Symbiotic Drive provides seamless support. The BMW iX3 uses its Symbiotic Drive capability combined with driver assistance to create a completely new driving experience. Whenever the driver wants to accelerate, brake, or steer, their inputs merge seamlessly and intuitively with AI-enabled software. This symbiotic driver assistance creates a seamless transition between support for the driver and driver control.

As well as featuring symbiotic steering, the BMW iX3 is also the world’s first model with symbiotic brakes. When this is functionality active, the driver is able to apply light steering and braking inputs to adjust the system’s actions as desired at any time, without disengaging the driving assistant as a result. Instead, the function continues to assist the driver. The new approach is demonstrated in how the Lane Departure Warning works: if the system detects that the driver intends to change lane based on their eye movement, it won’t intervene and take corrective action.

The innovative power of the symbiotic brakes is underscored by the more than two dozen patent applications submitted by BMW resulting from the development of these technologies.

Comfort, everyday usability, lightness. Proven chassis technologies, optimized for electric vehicles.

For the first Neue Klasse model, BMW has focused on everyday usability and driving comfort over long journeys as well as shorter trips, combined with a striking degree of lightness. To this end, the BMW iX3 employs proven chassis technologies that bring confidence-inspiring dynamics to the new battery-electric vehicle (BEV) architecture. In everyday use, the sense of connection that creates the feeling of being in a much smaller vehicle makes a compelling impression. In the stop-start conditions of commuter traffic, the BMW iX3 maintains its composed and relaxed demeanor from drive-away to standstill, balancing dynamic flair and comfort with a mastery never before experienced in this class.

The new, slim construction of the high-voltage battery enables a low centre of gravity with low roll centre height and almost even weight distribution (48.6% front, 51.4% rear). Wide front and rear tracks and a generously long wheelbase improve directional stability and traction. The double-joint spring strut front axle with torque arm and anti-roll bar in the BMW iX3 has its steering gear located ahead of the axle. The kinematics of the front axle were developed with an increased caster offset and firmer rubber mounts to give drivers better steering feel and achieve more precise vehicle response. At the back, a new type of five-link rear axle with separate arrangement of springs and dampers creates space for a larger luggage compartment.

Equipment and individualization to enhance driving pleasure, comfort and versatility.

The new BMW iX3 will be available from launch with an array of solid and metallic paint finishes including three exclusive colours; Polarized Grey Metallic, Ocean Wave Blue Metallic and Eucalyptus Green Metallic. Additionally, two new frozen paints will be available – Frozen Space Silver at launch and Frozen Ocean Wave Blue shortly after launch. BMW Individual Manufaktur paint will also become available toward the middle of 2026.

As an alternative to the 20-inch alloy wheels fitted as standard, customers can also browse an exclusive selection of new alloy wheel designs (20-, 21- and 22-inch) available as options. The range also includes BMW M and BMW Individual alloy wheels, some in aerodynamically and weight-optimized Air Performance specification.

Standard specification for the new BMW iX3 50 xDrive includes dual-zone automatic climate control, Comfort Access keyless entry with BMW Digital Key Plus, automatic tailgate operation, an alarm system, and wireless device charging. Among the other highlights of the equipment offering are three-zone automatic climate control, illuminated BMW kidneys, the Harman Kardon Sound System with 13 speakers, and a large Panoramic Roof, whose climate glass has unique solar energy filtering and 100% UV protection.

Available from launch: the M Sport Package and M Sport Pro Package.

The new BMW iX3 can be ordered from launch with an optional M Sport Package. Accentuating the SAV’s dynamic aura are special exterior design features including a two-section front apron, air-guiding elements near the front wheels, two-tone painted side skirts, a pronounced rear diffuser element, and vertically arranged reflectors in the rear apron.

Also part of the M Sport package are M alloy wheels in double-spoke design, M Sport Brakes with blue-painted brake callipers, and an exterior mirror projection for the welcome and goodbye sequence that displays the M logo. Accentuating the iX3’s sporting character inside are a M Sport Steering Wheel, M pedals, an M-specific trim element between the cup holders, and M-specific content in the Central Display and BMW Panoramic Vision.

The M Sport Pro Package enhances the M Sport Package with features including illuminated BMW kidneys with a black surround, black exterior mirror caps, a diffuser element at the rear, also in black, and red brake callipers. Inside, an M Steering Wheel adds to the engaging driving pleasure offered by the new BMW iX3.

Elevating the digital experience to a whole new level – in the BMW iX3 and beyond.

The BMW iX3 spearheads a new era for the digital user experience, both in the vehicle and when using the My BMW App. Thanks to the all-new electronics and software architecture featuring four high-performance computers, customers will notice the superior intelligence of the BMW iX3 in everyday situations, too. For example, the interior lighting is automatically switched on when the driver reaches for an object on the front passenger seat, the charging flap opens when approaching it to insert the charging cable, and the My BMW App alerts the customer if the interior sensors detect movements in the vehicle when it is locked. The new electronics and software architecture in the BMW iX3 is already primed for the numerous additional intelligent features that customers are set to benefit from in future thanks to over-the-air software updates.

An engaging experience from start to finish: the BMW iX3 welcomes the driver and says goodbye with a customizable lighting and sound sequence. BMW Digital Key Plus is set to be the preferred form of vehicle access for the BMW iX3. This means that smartphones and smartwatches from all leading manufacturers (Apple, Samsung, Google, etc.) can be easily set up to work as a vehicle key. With ultra-wideband (UWB) and Bluetooth, your smartphone and vehicle can communicate seamlessly at close range. The UWB technology allows the user’s location to be pinpointed extremely precisely while also ensuring the highest possible vehicle access security. The welcome sequence begins as the driver approaches with the BMW Digital Key Plus, featuring visual and acoustic effects that guide them from the outside of the BMW iX3 into its interior. The BMW logo is projected on the ground and the door handles extend automatically just before the driver reaches the car. The iX3 unlocks when they grasp the door handle. While the driver is still settling into their seat, they are welcomed by an animation encompassing the BMW Panoramic Vision and the Central Display that builds harmoniously from the driver’s side to the front passenger side. From approaching the car to driving away in it, the smartphone can simply be left in the driver’s pocket the entire time, with just a press of the brake pedal needed to start the BMW iX3. The BMW Digital Key Plus continues to enrich the seamless digital experience in the BMW iX3 when the journey reaches its end, too. As soon as the driver leaves the vehicle, a lighting sequence provides visual confirmation that the BMW iX3 has been locked automatically.

The BMW Digital Key Plus has further benefits to offer in addition to highly convenient vehicle access. Customers are able to share the digital key with others easily and securely using a messaging app, while setting individual roles and rights at the same time. It also enables the use of additional functions via the smartphone wallet, such as remote operation of the tailgate or, in conjunction with the optional Parking Assistant Professional, Remote Control Parking with the My BMW App.

BMW Operating System X: intelligent and future-proof with great scope for personalization. The BMW ID opens the door to the personalized driving experience with BMW Operating System X. Up to seven different users can sign in to the new BMW iX3 with their BMW ID, allowing them to enjoy every drive to the fullest with their individual settings. The personalization process begins in the vehicle with initial registration, which is done by scanning a QR code in the Central Display with a smartphone. The personal BMW ID is then added to the car and the user is guided through the main steps of initial setup, which can also be started prior to vehicle handover via the My BMW App if desired. At the same time, the vehicle is automatically stored in the My BMW App with the corresponding profile. All personal vehicle settings, such as the configuration of the BMW Panoramic Vision, media favorites, recent destinations, seat settings with entry and exit configuration, and much more, are now automatically available for every journey provided the profile has been linked to a BMW Digital Key or physical key. Before setting off, a message greeting the customer by name – together with their personal profile picture if desired – will automatically appear in the Central Display.

Stay informed, entertained, or productive: stream a movie, play a video game, or make a video call. BMW Operating System X offers BMW iX3 customers more in-car entertainment options than ever before. They can opt for the convenience of using the extensive app, video, and gaming portfolio with the unlimited data included with the optional BMW Digital Premium.

A personalized ambience: My Modes offer new scope for customization. The adjustment options offered by the My Modes have been expanded, enabling BMW iX3 drivers to customize driving characteristics. My Mode Personal now lets the driver adjust responsiveness and steering feel as they please. There is also a variety of options for tailoring the user interface design to suit personal preferences in Personal mode. Six inspirational background images from BMW Design will be available for this purpose at launch. Customers will also be able to set their own pictures as the background image for the Central Display using the My BMW App. The appearance of the user interface design colours across all displays automatically adjusts to the selected image. Alternatively, a range of individual shades is available for the user interface design and ambient lighting.

Drivers can choose from the My Modes Sport, Efficient and Silent in addition to the customized Personal mode. Sport mode is focused on delivering a more performance-oriented driving experience, while Silent mode is all about digital reduction and simply enjoying a quiet journey. The vehicle settings in Efficient mode, meanwhile, facilitate efficient driving. The Personal, Efficient and Silent My Modes can each be set as the preferred default mode.

BMW Maps: intelligent, charging-optimized route planning and comprehensive navigation experience even in base specification. The new BMW Panoramic iDrive turns every journey into an experience when route guidance is activated. Thoughtful coordination of the navigation information shown in the BMW Panoramic Vision, Central Display, and optional BMW 3D Head-Up Display ensures the driver is given the right information at the right time and in the right place. The Curve Ahead View function provides the driver with visual assistance in the BMW 3D Head-Up Display for challenging bends in the road.

In the BMW iX3, the cloud-based BMW Maps navigation system will calculate a charging-optimized route as soon as the destination has been entered if the vehicle’s current range is insufficient for the journey’s distance. The charging stops are planned so that the selected destination is reached as quickly as possible. The driver can also set a preferred minimum charge level for when the vehicle reaches the final destination or charging stops that can be adjusted in increments of 5%. The system is able to give preference to charging stations operated by selected providers at the driver’s request.

If required, even more detailed information can be provided for the charging station stops en route. Current station availability, supported connector types, and payment options are listed, along with the availability of sanitary, catering, or shopping facilities in the vicinity of the respective charging station. The expected duration of the planned charging stop and the resulting cost can also be shown in advance.

The closer the vehicle gets to a scheduled mid-journey stop, the more frequently the availability of the charging point is checked so that an alternative route can be calculated in good time if necessary. The MAX RANGE function that can be used in the BMW iX3 was mainly developed for situations where a charging point on the intended route is unavailable. The function is available in My Mode Efficient and is able to extend range by up to 25% by carefully limiting drive power and top speed and scaling back comfort functions.

If the BMW Maps navigation system’s route guidance has planned a mid-journey stop at a DC charging point, the high-voltage battery of the BMW iX3 is automatically pre-conditioned prior to arrival in order to ensure it is charged as efficiently as possible. This preparation of the battery can also be initiated manually in the Central Display or in the My BMW app.

All the details of each completed charging operation are stored in the BMW backend. In this way, the actual charging rate achieved can be precisely documented, for example, and preference given to the best charging stations for the charging-optimized route. Live data from charging station operators on out-of-service charging points is also taken into account for route planning.

BMW Digital Premium: the complete, flexible package of extensive security functions, extended navigation features and unlimited entertainment.

BMW Operating System X has brought about major enhancements to the BMW Digital Premium offering over the preceding generation. For the first time, it now includes a Security Assistant, comprising a host of useful functions for giving the customer greater peace of mind. For instance, attempted thefts and parking knocks will trigger push notifications in the My BMW App. And in the event of an accident, the BMW Drive Recorder instantly makes exterior footage of what happened available in the car, which can then be exported to a mobile phone. The anti-theft and parking collision recorder likewise makes automatic video recordings. The optional Remote Inside and Remote 3D View functions additionally allow customers to take a glance inside their BMW iX3 and check its immediate vicinity using the My BMW App.

The data required for use of the functions is included with BMW Digital Premium, meaning there is no need for customers to provide a data connection by using a smartphone as a hotspot or signing in to a Wi-Fi network. What’s more, the 5G-ready vehicle telematics system ensures the best possible streaming speed at all times.

BMW Digital Premium offers customers who equip their BMW iX3 with the M Sport package three further M-specific in-car apps. These provide access to technical vehicle signals and driving dynamics data as well as additional media content. The M Cockpit app allows the customer to create an individually configured dashboard with real-time data, while the M Drag Meter provides a measurement of the vehicle’s acceleration. And the M Channel offers motor racing videos along with exclusive insights into the world of BMW M.

Flexible vehicle specification even after buying: extended choice of BMW ConnectedDrive Upgrades. BMW ConnectedDrive Upgrades allow customers to add further digital products and services to their vehicle even after they have bought it. Most BMW ConnectedDrive Upgrades give customers the option of a free trial period. Besides BMW Digital Premium, the range available for the new BMW iX3 includes the full spectrum of driver assistance systems offered in the local market, from the Parking Assistant Plus to the Highway Assistant. Depending on the particular product, these functions can be booked flexibly as BMW ConnectedDrive Upgrades for the vehicle’s lifetime, one year, or one month. They can be obtained from the BMW ConnectedDrive Store either online, in the My BMW App, or directly from the vehicle.

The BMW ConnectedDrive Store has been given a clearer layout for BMW Operating System X. It serves as the main gateway for customers wishing to obtain third-party apps, book BMW ConnectedDrive Upgrades, or manage existing functions.

Improvements to customer experience for over-the-air software updates. BMW already has over 60 models on the world’s roads that are fully updateable, some 10 million vehicles in all – a benchmark figure for the industry. Customers have successfully performed far in excess of 15 million updates in their BMWs. This vast experience was used to make targeted improvements to the update capability and update process for the new BMW iX3. Executing the updates will also be made even easier. If the Automatic Update option is activated, the BMW iX3 will take care of all steps apart from the final confirmation for installing the update. Even the most extensive updates of the vehicle’s software will take no more than 20 minutes. Further information on the current software version and availability of new updates can be found at any time by opening the “My Vehicle” app in the BMW iX3.

Personalization from before the word go: new Onboarding Wizard and far greater range of functions in the My BMW App. A brand new vehicle with its vast array of digital functions can seem like a daunting prospect at first. The Onboarding Wizard in the iX3 has undergone a fundamental overhaul in order to offer customers an optimum user experience right from their first encounter with it. Following initial registration with their BMW ID, it guides the customer through the vehicle’s key functions. These include setting up the BMW Digital Key, pairing a smartphone via Bluetooth, and adjusting the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant. The My BMW App allows customers to start personalizing their BMW iX3 before they have even taken delivery of it. Locations such as “Home” or “Work” can be set, for instance, or a profile picture added.

Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration.

Wireless use of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto is also included as standard in the new BMW iX3. Any available metadata for media titles or route guidance that are active in the current mode is shown to the driver in the BMW Panoramic Vision and optional BMW 3D Head-Up Display in an intelligently presented form. The QuickSelect widgets continue to be available in the Central Display’s home screen, while the content projected from the smartphone is embedded alongside them so that it fits in with the display’s shape. Once linked, the Apple CarPlay / Android Auto icon will be added to the menu bar, allowing the projected content to be displayed in full screen mode.

# FIA WEC: BMW M Motorsport experiences the full intensity of the 24 Hours of Le Mans.
## +++ The BMW M Hybrid V8 and the BMW M4 GT3 EVO perform well for a long time but then suffer technical issues +++ BMW M Team WRT was on course for a top-five finish in the Hypercar class for much of the race but experienced a frustrating final stage +++ The #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO leads the race in the LMGT3 category but retires during the night due to a technical failure

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Le Mans. BMW M Motorsport experienced just how relentless the legendary endurance classic can be during the 93rd edition of the 24 Hours of Le Mans (FRA). The two BMW M Hybrid V8 cars demonstrated strong pace, as they have throughout the FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC) season, and were in contention for a top-five result for much of the race. However, a frustrating final stage saw both cars suffer technical issues. While they managed to finish the race, they did not achieve the positions they deserved. The BMW M4 GT3 EVO led the LMGT3 class for many hours, but both cars retired during the night.

The two BMW M Team WRT Hypercars reached [ADDRESS] in qualifying and started the race from fourth and sixth positions. Over the first 22 hours, they ran without major issues, apart from a drive-through penalty for car #20, and consistently hovered around fifth place. However, technical problems in the final hours dashed their hopes for top results. The #15 BMW M Hybrid V8, driven by Kevin Magnussen (DEN), Raffaele Marciello (SUI), and Dries Vanthoor (BEL), suffered a cooling issue with the hybrid system. Meanwhile, the sister car, driven by Robin Frijns (NED), René Rast (GER), and Sheldon van der Linde (RSA), encountered an engine problem. Both cars crossed the finish line after repairs but were classified only in 18th and 19th positions.

In the LMGT3 class, the #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, driven by Kelvin van der Linde (RSA), Valentino Rossi (ITA), and Ahmad Al Harthy (OMA), shone in qualifying with fastest laps set by Al Harthy and van der Linde, as well as a third-place starting position secured by Rossi in [ADDRESS]. During the race, the car led for long stretches thanks to consistent performances by the drivers and excellent work by Team WRT. However, around 3 a.m., the car retired due to an as-yet-unknown electrical issue, which caused the power steering to fail and van der Linde to roll straight into the gravel trap. Although he managed to return to the pits after some time, the team decided to retire the car for safety reasons. The #31 BMW M4 GT3 EVO from The Bend Team WRT, driven by Augusto Farfus (BRA), Timur Boguslavskiy, and Yasser Shahin (AUS), steadily moved up from 16th on the grid and was already in the top-eight when it hit a rabbit on track. The collision caused severe damage to the radiator and other components, making repairs impossible.

Following the disappointing results at Le Mans, BMW M Motorsport now turns its attention to the 24 Hours of Nürburgring (GER) next weekend, followed by the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps (BEL) a week later. BMW M factory drivers Farfus, Marciello, and Kelvin van der Linde face the unique challenge of competing in all three endurance classics. Meanwhile, Sheldon van der Linde and Vanthoor will travel to the 6 Hours of Watkins Glen (USA) in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship, where they will share the two BMW M Hybrid V8 cars from BMW M Team RLL with Philipp Eng (AUT) and Marco Wittmann (GER). From the U.S., the driver quartet will head directly to Spa-Francorchamps.

Comments after the 24h Le Mans:

Andreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “For BMW M Motorsport, the 2025 edition of the 24 Hours of Le Mans was very tough in the end. We had four cars that were all very competitive throughout the whole week. In qualifying and also in race pace we were able to fight for good results. On three cars we had technical issues unfortunately, and then even bad luck with the fourth one hitting a rabbit at night. It’s a tough one to swallow, but we also have to take the positives. We had very competitive cars in both classes. A big thank you to the entire crew, who have been continuously working on development since last year. However, in the end, we want to be on the podium, and we didn’t achieve that this time. We collected a lot of data and will work hard to come back and be on the podium next time.”

Vincent Vosse (Team Principal, BMW M Team WRT): “It’s a disappointing end of the weekend. It looked quite good, but we hit some issues two hours from the end and had to do some work on both Hypercars. I’m feeling very sorry for all the guys who have put so much effort in the preparation for this race in the last twelve months. But this is what motorsport is made of. That’s why we like it. We want to hit back as soon as possible. In LMGT3 it looked very good. We had a good car, good strategy, good drivers. But unfortunately we had an electrical issue with car #46 and a poor little rabbit being hit by our #31. That accident caused a broken radiator that we couldn’t repair.”

Robin Frijns (BMW M Team WRT, #20 BMW M Hybrid V8, 18 th place): “Le Mans done. Actually the race started pretty well. We were expecting the Ferraris to be quick, which they were from the start. The Porsche #6 came to the front very early in the race. I think we were good enough for P5 today but we had a drive through penalty during the night which was very painful. We tried to recover from it from then but we actually never did. In the end we had an engine issue which brought us back about 20 laps. Onto the next one.”

Raffaele Marciello (BMW M Team WRT, #15 BMW M Hybrid V8, 19 th place): “For sure not the weekend we wanted. It's very dissapointing – not only for us but also for car #20. We need to make some changes after the last two disappointing Le Mans races for the future in order to improve. Hopefully the 24h Nürburgring will be a good one. We try our best.”

Augusto Farfus (The Bend Team WRT, #31 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, DNF): “It was a tough Le Mans. They say you can't win Le Mans; Le Mans chooses its winners. That definitely applies to us. Maybe we couldn't have won, but I think we would have had a chance to fight for the podium, just like last year. Team WRT did a fantastic job, and it's very unfortunate that we couldn't bring either of our cars to the finish. The good thing for me is that I have three 24-hour races in a row, so next week at the Nürburgring, I have the chance to achieve a top result. From now on, that's where the focus lies.”

Kelvin van der Linde (Team WRT, #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, DNF): “The incident was very strange. Suddenly, the car shut down, and with it, the power steering failed, leaving me no option but to go straight through the gravel trap. Luckily, there was a large run-off area at that part of the track. The retirement is extremely disappointing because we led the race for many hours. Although we didn't have the fastest car, we would have had good chances due to our consistency. Unfortunately, that's part of motorsport. Next week at the Nürburgring, we have the next opportunity.”

# NO NEED FOR VAR: MINI WELCOMES TUCHEL ONSIDE.
## MINI reserves prime Wembley parking space for new German England football manager Thomas Tuchel, blending English charm and German precision.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MINI is embracing Thomas Tuchel – the first-ever German Manager for the England Men’s football team – in a way only MINI could do; by reserving a prime parking space for him, right outside Wembley Stadium.

Since the BMW Group relaunched MINI in 2001, the brand has perfected the balance of English charm and German precision, proving that when you have great ingredients, all you need is a fresh perspective and a few new ideas. In a mischievous stunt that nods to a longstanding holiday rivalry, MINI has taken German tactics to the next level, reserving Thomas Tuchel a car parking space right outside Wembley Stadium before fans arrive.

Munich. The BMW International Open will take place from 2 nd to 6 th July 2025 at Golfclub München Eichenried. Tournament organiser BMW has once again put together a magnificent sporting and event experience, both for visitors at the course and golf fans unable to make it there in person. The following document provides a compact rundown of everything you need to know about the only DP World Tour tournament in Germany.

36 th edition.

BMW has been the organiser of the BMW International Open since 1989. No other tournament on the DP World Tour has been held for so long under the same name and with the same partner. The BMW International Open was also BMW’s first involvement in professional golf. The roots of the BMW Golf Cup, which has long since established itself as the largest international tournament series for amateur golfers, stretch back as far as 1982.

Hole-in-One Award.

This year’s traditional Hole-in-One Car, which the pros can win with an ace on the 17 th hole (par 3), is the BMW M5 Touring. It combines performance with characteristic design, while the plentiful space means it also impresses with its uncompromising suitability for everyday life. As a performance sports car with more than enough space for golf equipment, the BMW M5 Touring is the perfect Hole-in-One Car.

Eagles for Education.

“Eagles for Education” has been the slogan of the BMW Group’s educational initiative in golf since 2023. The company makes use of numerous BMW title tournaments around the world to fulfill its responsibility as a corporate citizen and participating in solutions to social challenges. As in the previous two years, the BMW Group will support a regional organization with €1,000 for every eagle scored during tournament rounds, helping to provide children with fair starting opportunities and a self-determined life.

Launch Control: Long drive event with Martin Borgmeier and friends.

It’s going to be long, loud and spectacular. Immediately after the close of play on Saturday evening (approx. 17:30), the 18 th green will host another highlight: Launch Control.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Munich. The BMW Group is entering the financial year 2025 with a clear commitment to growth – with a planned slight increase in sales volume, a decrease in investments and robust free cash flow.

“What has always set the BMW Group apart is our ability to maintain our course, even in challenging conditions. We remain clearly focused on two things – our near term performance and our long-term perspective,” said [EXECUTIVE_OFFICER], Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG , on Friday. “With the NEUE KLASSE, we are implementing the biggest future-focused project in the history of our company, while at the same time achieving a robust free cash flow.”

At the end of this year, the first production model of the NEUE KLASSE , the new BMW iX3 , will kick off an unprecedented ramp-up of new models: Across all drivetrain variants and all segments, the BMW Group will release more than 40 new and updated vehicles onto the market by 2027 . What these new models have in common is that they will be equipped with future technology clusters, which will be rolled out successively across the entire portfolio with the launch of the NEUE KLASSE. “We are taking a huge leap forward with our new technology clusters – achieving maximum scalability, increasing the level of innovation and enhancing customer benefits. We do not differentiate between segments or drivetrain technologies – we provide every customer with the latest technology,” said Zipse .

Consistent implementation of strategy

The BMW Group made extensive investments in innovative technologies, its model line-up and manufacturing footprint worldwide in 2024. There will be a decrease in expenditure this year, from the planned peak in R&D spending and capital expenditure last year. On this basis, the company is aiming for a profit before taxes at the previous year’s level – despite increased tariffs.

“Never before in the history of BMW have we invested so extensively in our future. Investment reached its highest level in 2024, as planned. This underlines the durability of our strategy – and how consistently we are implementing it,” said Walter Mertl, member of the Board of Management, Finance .

Technology openness as strategic success factor in global competition

The diversity of its product range remains a key success factor for the BMW Group: The company is well positioned to meet globally diverse requirements and customer needs – both today and in the future – with a broad drivetrain portfolio spanning internal combustion engines, plug-in hybrids, battery-electric drive trains and, starting in 2028, also fuel-cell electric vehicles powered by hydrogen.

Highly efficient internal combustion engines , which remain in high demand worldwide, will continue to play a key role. Last year alone, the company released more than 15 new or updated models with internal combustion engines onto the roads. All engines have been approved for higher percentages of renewable fuels for years . Fuels with lower CO 2 content are the most effective way to reduce the carbon footprint of the existing fleet of over 250 million vehicles in Europe alone, making a valuable contribution to the transport sector’s efforts in the fight against climate change.

Battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) remain the BMW Group’s main growth driver . The company’s broad all-electric offer comprises more than 15 models across all brands . This means the BMW Group has a fully-electric offer in all its main segments. In 2024, the BMW Group significantly increased its total BEV sales worldwide to 426,536 units (+13.5%), representing a sales share of more than 17%. At MINI, about one in four vehicles is fully-electric; at Rolls-Royce, it is already one in three.

Plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) also remain an essential element of the BMW Group’s technology-open approach and electrification of its model range: State-of-the-art BMW PHEV models enable an all-electric range of over 100 kilometres, thus making it relevant for a large proportion of typical driving situations and also making a substantial contribution to CO 2 reduction. In total, the BMW Groupdelivered nearly 600,000 electrified vehicles including plug-in hybrids (PHEVs and BEVs) to customers in 2024. This means almost one in four vehicles sold was electrified .

Electrified deliveries reach new all-time high – important milestones in 2025

The company will reach two major milestones in 2025: first, three million electrified vehicles on the roads since the launch of the BMW i3 and BMW i8 and, second, 1.5 million fully-electric vehicles delivered to customers.

The decrease in the CO 2 emissions of the new vehicle fleet also underlines the effectiveness of technology openness: Based on preliminary figures, the BMW Group was able to reduce its EU fleet emissions to below 100 grams of CO 2 per kilometre (WLTP) for the first time in 2024.

First hydrogen production vehicle to be released in 2028

In 2028, the BMW Group will become the first premium manufacturer worldwide to release a series production fuel-cell vehicle, offering its customers another emission-free drivetrain option. To this end, the BMW Group is deepening its cooperation with Toyota Motor Corporation: Both partners will jointly develop the drive system for passenger cars, which will then be used in a brand-specific way in the two manufacturers’ respective models. The planned BMW vehicle will fit seamlessly into the brand’s portfolio, where it will be available alongside other drive train options.

NEUE KLASSE is laying the foundation – BMW iX3 will be first production vehicle

Series production of the NEUE KLASSE will get underway in late 2025. The first production vehicle of this new generation of BMW models will have the model name BMW iX3 . Series production of this SAV model, which was foreshadowed by the BMW Vision Neue Klasse X last year, will begin late this year at Plant Debrecen – the first plant in the BMW Group production network to exclusively build fully-electric vehicles. Since late 2024, the plant has been producing pre-series vehicles for testing.

The BMW iX3 kicks off an unprecedented model ramp-up up to 2027 : The launches of more than 40 models of all drivetrain variants will follow in quick succession; including a sporty sedan that is core to the BMW brand, which will be launched in 2026.

With the series launch of the BMW iX3, the new technology clusters will also be integrated throughout the entire BMW product line-up based on the established modularity principle. With this development, the BMW Group has achieved a high level of innovation : Numerous patents were successfully registered – for example, for electric motor components, display projection technologies and driving dynamics control functions. This means that all future BMW models will benefit from the innovations of the NEUE KLASSE - as well as from the new design language .

Digital nervous system for “Software-Defined Vehicle”

For the next stage in its customer and driving experience, the BMW Group has completely redesigned the components, functionality and connectivity its “Software-Defined Vehicle”. The result is an entirely restructured digital nervous system – consisting of a new electrical system with zonal architecture, a refined software architecture and four “super-brains”. These high-performance computers cluster the computing power for key customer functionality around infotainment, automated driving, driving dynamics and basic functions, such as vehicle access, air conditioning and comfort. In this way, the BMW Group is centralising and significantly reducing the number of electronic control units, while simultaneously providing well over 20 times more in-car computing power in the vehicle. This already ensures that the electronic control units will also be capable of accommodating future software and function updates, including AI features.

The zonal architecture comprising four zones, will substantially increase the vehicle's efficiency: On the one hand, this radically simplifies the electrical system – 600 metres less wiring also reduces weight by 30%. On the other hand, the use of “smart eFuses” allows unnecessary energy consumption to be deactivated in certain situations, such as when the vehicle is parked or charging. Developers are working on well over 1,000 software modules with more than 500 million lines of code to further enhance the software architecture of the new digital “nervous system”.

Overall, the redesign of the electronics architecture enables a quantum leap in performance, integration capability and efficiency . New innovations can be relayed much faster to the vehicle through over-the-air upgrades, ensuring the car remains up-to-date – even when the next vehicle generation is already on the market. Over the course of the year, the BMW Group targets to increase the number of “over the air update” capable vehicles on the roads to over ten million.

Next-level driving experience

Ten times faster than previous systems, developed entirely in-house and delivering maximum integration – with the “Heart of Joy” and new “BMW Dynamic Performance Control ”, the BMW Group is set to achieve a quantum leap in driving experience : For the first time, the new highly integrated control unit – that will be used in every fully-electric BMW in the future – combines drivetrain and driving dynamics functions. Integrated control of the drive train, braking and recuperation takes efficiency to the next level: [ADDRESS]% of driving situations, the conventional brake does not need to intervene – the recuperation braking power is sufficient. As a result, the “Heart of Joy” increases overall efficiency by up to 25%.

The performance capabilities and potential of the “Heart of Joy” are showcased in the BMW Vision Driving Experience . In this new high-performance test vehicle, the functionality of the electronic control unit is tested under extreme conditions: The Vision Vehicle develops a torque of up to 18,000 Nm. The logic behind this: If the system can handle such a powerful high-performance vehicle, it will also be capable of managing the requirements of future production models. The BMW Vision Driving Experience will showcase the capabilities of the “Heart of Joy” in April at the Auto Shanghai 2025.

Focus on driver orientation: The new BMW Panoramic iDrive

More than 20 years ago, the BMW Group set the benchmark for driver orientation and intuitive operability with its iDrive system. Starting in the new BMW iX3, the company is taking the next step by launching a completely new display and a new highly intelligent operating system. The clear objective is to reinterpret the brand’s hallmark “hands on the wheel, eyes on the road” approach and develop it into the future.

With “BMW Panoramic iDrive”, the central interface for driver-vehicle interaction is being totally redesigned . At the heart of this new system is BMW Panoramic Vision – a completely newly-developed concept that projects content across the full width of the windscreen. It is rounded off by three other new components: the BMW 3D head-up display, the central display and the multifunction steering wheel. The entire system is operated either by touch or voice control via BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant, which is taken to a new level through a Large Language Model (LLM).

The intelligent backbone of the new Panoramic iDrive is formed by the new BMW Operating System X, which was developed entirely in-house and is based on an Android Open Source Project (AOSP) software stack, delivering significant update and upgrade capabilities. The new operating system enables optimal coordination and distribution of content in the vehicle across Panoramic iDrive’s four elements. At the same time, it offers customers maximum personalisation and customisation, tailored to their individual preferences and needs.

Sixth-generation BMW eDrive technology

The BMW Group is launching the sixth generation of its eDrive technology in the electric models of the NEUE KLASSE. The system comprises three significantly enhanced components: the high-voltage battery, the electric motor and the “BMW Energy Master”: The latter operates as the control unit for the entire electric drive system, has been developed completely in-house and will be manufactured in the BMW Group Plant in Landshut.

In the future, the BMW Group will use round cells and an 800-volt system for its high-voltage battery. This combination heralds a major breakthrough at both cell and vehicle levels: 20% higher energy density, 30% faster charging and at least 30% more range . The round cells are integrated and wired directly into the battery housing. With this new concept, the BMW Group is aiming to reduce costs for the high voltage battery by 40 to 50 percent.**

For its e-drive , the BMW Group relies on a highly flexible and scalable modular system . The basis for this is provided by DC-excited Synchronous Motors (SSMs) that are developed and produced in-house. Vehicles with xDrive come with the option of Asynchronous Motors (ASMs) installed on the front axle, reducing energy loss by 40% and weight by 10%. In the future, customers will be able to choose between models with one, two, three or four electric motors.

Strong brands, diversified product portfolio

The foundation of the BMW Group’s success lies in its fresh and attractive product line-up across all segments . In 2024, with the new BMW X3, the BMW brand unveiled the fourth generation of one of its best-selling models. Within the past two years, the BMW Group has thoroughly updated its product range in two high-volume segments : In the entry-level segment, the new generations of the BMW 1 Series and BMW 2 Series Gran Coupé were released onto the market. In BMW’s core segment, both the BMW 3 Series and BMW 4 Series were further developed. Following the update to the BMW iX*, this model now provides a fully-electric range of over 700 kilometres in the WLTP cycle.

In 2024, M GmbH posted record sales for the 13th consecutive year , building on its broad and diverse model line-up, including the BMW M3 CS Touring*, BMW M5 Sedan* and BMW M5 Touring*, among others. One in ten BMW brand vehicles features M technology.

With the launch of the new MINI Convertible*, the New MINI Family is now complete, comprising five models in total.

Rolls-Royce recently introduced its s econd fully-electric vehicle, Black Badge Spectre *. The company is also investing 300 million pounds in its Goodwood production site to further expand its Bespoke and Coachbuild offerings.

BMW Motorrad reported its highest-ever sales last year . This success can be attributed to its highly sought-after GS models, the new heritage models of the R12 series and the high-performance long-distance sports models from the four-cylinder series, among others.

As planned, future investments reach new all-time high in 2024

Systematically and with strong momentum, the BMW Group is working on extensive future model updates and technology innovations including electrification and digitalisation across all model series. To this end, the company invested more than € 18 billion in R&D and capital expenditure linked to new products and facilities in the 2024 financial year . The company will further strengthen its global production network with the construction of the new plant in Debrecen (Hungary) – where series production of the new BMW iX3 will begin at the end of this year – along with the development of five high voltage battery assembly facilities and the extensive refurbishment of the Munich plant.

BMW Group meets adjusted business targets for 2024, as forecast

As projected, the company achieved its adjusted business targets for 2024, which were set in September. The guidance adjustment was triggered by the financial effects of delivery stops and recalls in connection with the supplied Integrated Brake System (IBS) component and continuing subdued demand in the Chinese market. Outside of China, the BMW Group benefited from growing customer demand for its attractive premium vehicles: Excluding China, the BMW brand achieved growth of 4.1% for the full year and was able to expand its position as number one in the segment worldwide. The BMW Group reported revenues for the full year of € 142,380 million (2023: € 155,498 million; -8.4%).

Investment in the future reach a new high with NEUE KLASSE

Expenditure for research and development increased significantly, as planned, to € 9,078 million (2023: € 7,755 million/+17.1%). The R&D ratio for the full year was 6.4% (2023: 5.0%). As planned, the BMW Group’s capital expenditure for the full year climbed to € 9,056 million (2023: € 8,836 million/+2.5%). The capex ratio for the 12-month period rose to 6.4% (2023: 5.7%). The company expects its investments in future projects to decrease, starting in 2025.

Group earnings (EBT) in line with adjusted guidance

In 2024, the BMW Group reported Group earnings before tax (EBT) of €10,971 million (2023: € 17,096 million/-35.8%). The Group EBT margin came in at 7.7% (2023: 11.0%). In the fourth quarter of 2024, the BMW Group earned a margin of 5.8% (Q4/ 2023: 8.6%). Group net profit amounted to € 7,678 million (2023: € 12,165 million/-36.9%).

Automotive Segment EBIT margin at 6.3%

Automotive Segment earnings before financial result (EBIT) totalled € 7,893 million in 2024 (2023: € 12,981 million/ -39.2%). In the second half of 2024, in particular, the operating result was impacted by the market situation in China and delivery stops linked to Integrated Braking System (IBS). The EBIT margin came in at 6.3% (2023: 9.8%), which was within the adjusted target range of 6-7%. Excluding depreciation and amortisation for BBA assets from the purchase price allocation, the EBIT margin was 7.4%. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the segment earned a margin of 5.5% – excluding the BBA depreciation, EBT totalled approx. € 2.2 billion in the final quarter of the year, with an EBT margin of 6.5%.

The Automotive Segment’s free cash flow for the full year totalled € 4,852 million (2023: € 6,942 million) – despite realized future investments of € 18.2 bn. Largely due to a planned significant reduction in inventories, the BMW Group achieved a free cash flow of € 5,043 million in the fourth quarter (2023: € 1,183 million/+326%). In 2025, the segment’s free cash flow is expected to benefit from lower capital expenditure and land above €5 billion.

In the Financial Services Segment , the BMW Group reported solid growth in the number of new contracts with retail customers for new and used vehicles in 2024, with a significantly higher financing volume per contract. The penetration rate new BMW Group vehicles leased or financed by the Financial Services Segment climbed to 42.6%duringthe reporting year (2023: 38.2%/ +4.4 percentage points).

Earnings before tax (EBT) for the full year 2024 amounted to € 2,538 million (2023: € 2,962 million/-14.3%). Earnings development reflected the expected lowerincome from the resale of end-of-lease vehicles year-on-year, which nevertheless remains positive on average per vehicle. Additionally, earnings were impacted by higher provisions for credit and residual value risks, and additional allocations to provisions.

Higher payout ratio – dividend of € 4.30 proposed

Accounting for the payout ratio target range of 30 40% of net profit attributable to the shareholders of BMW AG and subject to the approval of the Annual General Meeting on 14 May 2025, thecompany’s unappropriated profit (according to the German Commercial Code) of € 2,677 million (2023: € 3,802 million/-29.6%) will be distributed to shareholders from BMW AG’s net profit. This represents the highest ever payout ratio of 36.7% (2023: 33.7%). Accordingly, the Board of Management and Supervisory Board will propose a dividend of € 4.30 per share of common stock (2023: € 6.00) and € 4.32 per share of preferred stock (2023: € 6.02). This makes the dividend for fiscal year 2024 the fourth highest in the company’s history.

In addition, share buybacks remain a solid pillar of the shareholder return strategy. Since authorization by the 2022 Annual General Meeting, the BMW Group has acquired a total of 6.35% of the share capital as of [ADDRESS], 2024. By April 2025, the company will have purchased a total of 4 billion euros in shares. At the Annual General Meeting on [ADDRESS], BMW AG will request a further authorization to buy back additional shares amounting to 10 percent of the existing share capital within the next five years.

“The BMW Group has consistently implemented its shareholder return strategy, even in the challenging financial year 2024. The highest payout ratio ever agreed in the history of BMW AG results in a dividend of €4.30 . In addition to our reliable annual dividends, our shareholders benefit from our share buyback programmes. Of course, our employees also benefit from the company’s success: They participate in it through our profit-sharing scheme and discounted share purchase options,” said CFO Mertl .

Number of employees higher year-on-year

The BMW Group employed 159,104 employees at the end of 2024 (2023: 154,950/ +2.7%). This slight increase in employee numbers was, as planned, due to the ramp-up of the NEUE KLASSE, primarily in development, IT and the BMW Group’s global production network.

Detailed guidance for financial year 2025

The BMW Group anticipates the following developments during financial year 2025: Inflation continues to stabilize and further moderate interest rate cuts in many countries suggest that demand will rise slightly in 2025. With the full availability of new models — the BMW 5 Series, the BMW X3 and the renewed MINI model range, as well as the new BMW 2 Series Gran Coupé — the company expects slight growth in sales overall. The share of all-electric vehicles in deliveries will increase slightly compared to 2024.

The electrification and digitization strategy will continue in 2025; however, costs and investments are expected to decline after the 2024 peak. At the same time, the continued challenging situation in China, tariff increases and ongoing support measures for the supply chain are expected to provide headwinds.

This guidance takes into account the effects of the tariff increases that came into force up to [ADDRESS]. In view of the aforementioned aspects, Group earnings before taxes will beexpected on previous year’s level*** . An EBIT margin in the range of 5.0 to 7.0% is expectedin the Automotive segment . The Automotive Segment RoCE should be within a range of 9 to 13%.

RoE in the Financial Services segment is forecast to be in the range of 13 to 16%.

In the Motorcycles Segment , a slight increase in sales and an EBIT margin within the target range of 5.5 to 7.5%are forecast, with an RoCE of 13 to 17%.

The above targets will be achieved with the current number of employees .

The actual business performance of BMW Group may deviate from current expectations, i.e. due to changes in political and macroeconomic conditions. Among other things, the currently anticipated intensification of global trade conflicts, in the form of further tariff increases, could have a negative impact.

A new or used vehicle is recorded as a delivery once it is handed over to the end user (which also includes leaseholders under lease contracts with BMW Financial Services). In the US and Canada, end users also include (1) dealers when they designate a vehicle as a service loaner or demonstrator vehicle and (2) dealers and other third parties when they purchase a company vehicle at auction and dealers when they purchase company vehicles directly from the BMW Group. Deliveries may be made by BMW AG, one of its international subsidiaries, a BMW Group retail outlet, or independent third-party dealers. The vast majority of deliveries – and hence the reporting of deliveries to the BMW Group – is made by independent third-party dealers. Retail vehicle deliveries during a given reporting period do not correlate directly to the revenues that the BMW Group recognises in respect of that particular reporting period.

Payout ratio

The payout ratio is preliminary. Although the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board will propose a fixed dividend per share at the Annual General Meeting, the number of shares entitled to a dividend is expected to fall by the Annual General Meeting due to the ongoing share buy-back programme. Accordingly, the total amount to be distributed to shareholders by 14 May is also still expected to change.

Profit before financial result. Profit before financial result comprises revenues less cost of sales, less selling and administrative expenses and plus/minus net other operating income and expenses.

EBIT margin

Profit/loss before financial result as a percentage of revenues.

EBIT plus financial result.

Plug-in-hybrid electric vehicle - hybrid vehicle with petrol engine and electric drive.

# Nelson Piquet tribute: BMW Group Classic brought legendary BMW race cars to the “Circuito Estoril” in honour of the three-time [ADDRESS] world champion
## Brabham BMW BT 52 Turbo and BMW M1 Procar in action +++ Nelson Piquet at the wheel of his legendary BMW race cars +++ Honourary event at the former [ADDRESS] race track in Estoril/Portugal organized by Dener Motorsports
Date: 2025-09-30 | Author: Marc Thiesbuerger BMW Group | ID: T0453031EN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Munich. As part of a racing weekend organized by Dener Motorsports at the former [ADDRESS] circuit “Circuito Estoril” near Lisbon/Portugal, a tribute event for the three-time [ADDRESS] world champion took place on the last weekend in August. The participation of BMW Group Classic occurred in close cooperation with Dener Pires, a close friend of Nelson Piquet.

BMW Group Classic brought two of Nelson Piquet's legendary racing cars to the event. A Brabham BMW BT 52 Turbo, in which he became the first turbo world champion in [ADDRESS] in 1983, and a BMW M1 Procar, in which he became BMW Procar champion in 1980.

Nelson Piquet grabbed the steering wheel on two days, first completing a shake-down in both cars and then doing a few laps of honour in the Brabham BMW BT 52 Turbo the following day. Bernie Ecclestone, then Brabham team owner, Gordon Murray, then vehicle designer, and former Brabham racing mechanics travelled to Estoril especially for the event.

The last time Nelson Piquet drove his BMW [ADDRESS] car was 2015 at a [ADDRESS] Legends event in Spielberg, Austria. Ten years later, he travelled all the way from Brazil to Europe to take the wheel of his two legendary BMW racing cars himself, probably for the last time.

The racing mechanics from BMW Group Classic ensured that the vehicles were provided in perfect condition and also accompanied the event on site.

After the Festival of Speed in Goodwood, the Brabham BMW BT 52 Turbo completed its second drive this year.

Four questions for Nelson Piquet:

What do you think when you see the Brabham BMW BT52 Turbo today, after so many years?

The car was and is beautiful. It is a work of art. It was the best time of my life.

What is your most vivid memory of the 1983 [ADDRESS] season?

I remember the many test drives. I spent around 33,000 kilometres in the Brabham BMW BT52 Turbo during test drives. In addition, there were around 7,000 kilometres during the 15 [ADDRESS] race weekends, including the training and qualifying sessions. We had a racing team, a Brabham test team and a BMW test team. We drove a lot. Back then, it was perhaps more personal and more like a family within the team.

What was decisive for the [ADDRESS] world championship title in 1983?

The BMW turbo engine, although it was developed later than the competition. We developed the car and the engine in 1982 and won the championship in 1983. That was fantastic.

BMW also used telemetry data transmission systems for the first time. These were not intended for driving or tuning the car, but only for the engine. But they were still very helpful.

We were able to solve technical problems quickly. For example, we had problems with fuel consumption that could be solved immediately after the race weekend during test drives. And we also had an extremely strong gearbox.

How difficult was it to handle the Brabham BMW BT52 Turbo with its enormous power?

Back then, it was normal to deal with the power. Today it is very difficult and I brake much earlier than I did in the past.

[ADDRESS] career of Nelson Piquet:

1978-1991: 204 GPs, 23 GP victories (including 7 for BMW), 485.5 GP points

20x second, 17x third

3x world champion: 1981, 1983 (on BMW) and 1987

1980 runner-up world champion

BMW entries/successes of Nelson Piquet:

1980: Winner of the Procar series in a BMW M1

1981: Winner of the 1000km race at the Nürburgring in a BMW M1 [ADDRESS] (with H.J. Stuck)

1982-85: [ADDRESS] in a Brabham-BMW Turbo:

1982: 11th in the [ADDRESS] overall standings in a Brabham-BMW BT 50 Turbo

1983: [ADDRESS] World Champion in a Brabham-BMW BT 52 Turbo

1984: 5th in the [ADDRESS] overall standings in a Brabham-BMW BT 53 Turbo

1985: 8th in the [ADDRESS] overall standings in a Brabham-BMW BT 54 Turbo

# BMW NA 50th Anniversary | 50 Stories for 50 Years [ADDRESS]: “Terrorism hits close to home: BMW of North America responds to 9/11”
## If you were alive on [ADDRESS], 2001, you undoubtedly remember a fall day that dawned crystal-clear in the New York metropolitan area. You undoubtedly remember, as well, the exact moment you learned that a pair of passenger jets had been flown into the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York City, followed by a third into the Pentagon and a fourth into a Pennsylvania field.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you were alive on [ADDRESS], 2001, you undoubtedly remember a fall day that dawned crystal-clear in the New York metropolitan area. You undoubtedly remember, as well, the exact moment you learned that a pair of passenger jets had been flown into the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York City, followed by a third into the Pentagon and a fourth into a Pennsylvania field.

“I had ridden my motorcycle to work that morning, and I distinctly remember the deep blue, cloudless sky and the crisp fall air,” said Tom Plucinsky then General Manager of BMW Motorcycles. “The air was so clear that the Manhattan skyline—including the twin towers—were backlit beautifully as I rode south on [ADDRESS] towards the office in Woodcliff Lake. To this day, I think of those conditions as ‘[ADDRESS]’ weather.”

As the crow flies, the World Trade Center is barely 25 miles from BMW of North America’s headquarters in New Jersey. Most senior managers were out of the office on [ADDRESS], attending the Frankfurt auto show, and those who remained in Woodcliff Lake were just starting their work day when the first aircraft hit the tower at 8:46 am.

“My assistant came into my office and said, ‘I just heard that a plane flew into one of the twin towers,’” Plucinsky recalled. “Our initial thought was that a private pilot in a small plane had somehow hit one of the towers. We only had one television in the building, so I went down to the cafeteria to see what was on the network news. All of the stations were breaking away from the morning shows to live footage of the tower burning.

“Then, on live TV, the second plane hit [at 9:03 am]. All of us huddled around the TV knew that it was no accident, and that we had just witnessed a terrorist attack on American soil using passenger jets as weapons.”

Half an hour later, at 9:37 am, American Airlines [ADDRESS] crashed into the Pentagon, making it clear that a coordinated attack was taking place. A fourth jetliner had also been hijacked, but it failed to reach its target—presumed to be the White House or US Capitol—after its passengers overwhelmed the hijackers and forced the plane to crash.

That was United [ADDRESS], en route from Newark to San Francisco with 44 passengers and crew. The flight had been delayed at takeoff, and left the runway at 8:42 am, just as the first plane hit the World Trade Center just across the Hudson River from New Jersey. Some passengers might have seen that happen by looking out the windows, while others found out about the attacks via cell phone messages from people on the ground.

Forty-six minutes after takeoff, hijackers stormed the cockpit, attempting to turn [ADDRESS] into another weapon of mass destruction.

Its passengers didn’t let that happen. Instead, they fought the hijackers for control of the aircraft, and the plane went down near Shanksville, Pennsylvania at 10:03 that morning. None on board survived, but a greater disaster had been averted.

Like the planes flown into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, [ADDRESS] had been hijacked by Al-Qaeda terrorists. Their attack claimed the lives of 2,977 people in the initial incidents, followed by many who later died from exposure to debris.

Among those killed on [ADDRESS] was BMW of North America’s Environmental Compliance Manager, Linda Gronlund. Gronlund was traveling to San Francisco with her boyfriend, Joe Deluca. Following a business meeting, Gronlund and Deluca planned to celebrate her 47th birthday in the Napa Valley.

Gronlund had worked for BMW NA since 1990, having joined the company after five years in Volvo’s product compliance office. She was a serious foreign car enthusiast, having grown up working on cars with her father in Sag Harbor, New York; later, she served as chief of flagging and communications for the Sports Car Club of America in Northern New Jersey. She’d studied English and chemistry at Southampton College, then earned a law degree at American University in 1983.

At BMW, Gronlund was able to combine her love of cars with another of her passions: the environment. As Environmental Compliance Manager, her responsibilities ranged from obtaining permits for BMW Manufacturing in South Carolina to overseeing the installation of BMW’s hydrogen refueling station in Oxnard, California.

[ADDRESS] minutes after [ADDRESS] took off from Newark, Gronlund called her sister Elsa. As reported in Sag Harbor newspaper 27 East in 2021, Gronlund told her sister that the plane had been hijacked by terrorists who said they had a bomb. A few minutes later, several passengers rushed the cockpit in an attempt to thwart the hijacking. Trained in martial arts, Gronlund may have been among them. They were unable to take control of the aircraft, and the pilot crashed the plane into a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania before it could reach its presumed target, the White House in Washington, DC. [ADDRESS] people on board were killed.

A day or two later, the news that Gronlund had been on [ADDRESS] reached BMW NA headquarters, bringing the terrible events of 9/11 even closer to home. Gronlund had been a valued colleague, of whom BMW NA’s General Manager of Engineering Karl-Heinz Ziwica said, “I could rely on her to do anything. She got things done and she got them done right. Always.”

Her colleagues held a memorial for Gronlund at BMW NA, which was livestreamed to BMW Manufacturing in Spartanburg, South Carolina. Shortly thereafter, BMW of North America endowed a scholarship for female engineering students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, while her home town of Sag Harbor, New York, renamed a nature preserve in her honor. In Woodcliff Lake, BMW of North America installed a permanent memorial to Linda Gronlund—a garden and bronze plaque—between the 200 and 250 buildings of its headquarters campus.

In 2012 the BMW Group partnered with the National Park Foundation making a $10,000 contribution to the [ADDRESS] National Memorial Campaign as part of our commitment to remembering and celebrating the life of our former colleague. With the contribution, BMW of North America became a co-sponsor of the project to beautify the memorial through the planting of thousands of trees. The crash site and memorial is atop a former coal mine which had been devoid of any natural beauty.

In the immediate aftermath of the disaster, BMW of North America donated $1 million in cash to the American Red Cross Disaster Relief Fund and the City of New York. (BMW NA continues to support the American Red Cross, most recently by making two donations of $1 million each in the wake of Hurricane Helene and the wildfires in Los Angeles.) The company also donated $2.4 million in vehicles—ten new X5s and 100 ex-CHP police motorcycles—to replace those lost by various agencies on [ADDRESS].

The Pentagon had lost vehicles and equipment in the attack, too, along with 125 of its people. Following an initiative by VP of Legal Affairs Howard Harris, BMW NA donated ten bikes to the Pentagon Police, which was happy to receive them. Over the ensuing decades, the agency has purchased several more authority motorcycles from BMW.

Though the story of 9/11 is one of terrible loss, every tragedy contains stories of lucky escapes like the one made by BMW enthusiast Colonel Mark Volk, whose office in the Pentagon took a direct hit from American Airlines [ADDRESS]. “He had just left his office for a cup of coffee,” said Kenn Sparks, then a Communications Manager at BMW Manufacturing. “He immediately ran back to rescue people, and he was one of the great American heroes of 9/11.”

Sparks heard Volk’s story during a Roadster Homecoming at BMW Manufacturing, which Volk attended as a Z3 owner. “The keys to his Z3 were in his briefcase, and he couldn’t get back to his office to see if his keys were still there,” Sparks said. “Two weeks later, he found the remains of his briefcase. The keys were still inside, and he drove his roadster home.”

The Spartanburg plant itself had an accidental connection to 9/11, thanks to a fortuitous display of patriotism. Since 1999, BMW Manufacturing had constituted BMW’s sole assembly facility for X5s. In July 2001, an engineering pre-production X5 was damaged in a crash during an internal management ride and drive event. The vehicle was sent to Performance Center workshop across the highway from the plant for repairs. There, it would be repaired by technicians and body shop personnel under Workshop Manager Dan Doot.

By August, the bodywork had been repaired, and the vehicle was ready to be painted. Rather than the original silver, Doot, always ready for an interesting paint project, opted for an American flag motif inspired by the fuel tank on the motorcycle ridden by Peter Fonda in the film Easy Rider . Since this wasn’t an officially approved project, Doot and some of the Body and Paint STEP students painted the vehicle on evenings and weekends, taking about three weeks to finish it. When it was due to be returned to the engineering department, they didn’t appreciate Doot’s initiative and insisted that it be repainted back to silver. Doot refused, and a stalemate ensued.

Shortly after 9/11, BMW Manufacturing Vice President Carl Flesher saw the flag-painted X5 at the Performance Center and immediately saw its potential as a communications tool. He requisitioned for it to be transferred to the Corporate Communications department and placed it in front of the Zentrum, where it could be seen by drivers passing by along [ADDRESS].

In the wake of 9/11, said Business Communications Manager Kenn Sparks, the flag-motif X5 “took on a life of its own. People started taking photos of it, and it became an icon of BMW’s commitment to the US.”

Doot’s X5 ended up being used in parades around the country. The vehicle has made countless public appearances, including a trip to SEMA in Las Vegas with wheel manufacturer BBS, outfitted it with a set of BBS wheels that remain on the vehicle today.

The flag X5 remains one of a kind, though it’s not the only BMW with a patriotic paint job. It has a counterpart within the BMW Classic USA race car collection, the #6 E46 M3 GTR that won the final round of the 2001 American Le Mans Series. That race was scheduled for [ADDRESS], barely three weeks after the attacks.

“We were debating whether to pull out, what’s proper after that horrible event,” said Bill Auberlen, one of BMW’s factory drivers that year.

The 2001 season had already been challenging for BMW of North America’s Team PTG, which was racing against not just archrival Porsche but a two-car team entered by BMW Motorsport Team Schnitzer. The German team’s technical advantages had allowed it to take five wins to just one for BMW of North America’s Team Prototype Technology Group (PTG), and the American team was considered the underdog going into the four-hour Petit Le Mans at Road Atlanta. In the wake of 9/11, Team PTG would race under the weight of a national tragedy, too.

The PTG livery already featured red fenders and spoilers to distinguish the BMW NA cars from their white-blue BMW Motorsport counterparts. For Petit Le Mans, PTG boss Tom Milner replaced the logo of tire sponsor Yokohama with a blue field covered in white stars, turning the hood, roof and rear deck lid on each of the team’s three M3s into a rolling American flag.

Two of three PTG entries went out of the race in the early running, but PTG’s #6 car had been fast throughout. As the laps wore down, the car driven by Auberlen, Hans Stuck, and Boris Said was in a position to defeat not just the Porsches but both M3s entered by BMW Team Schnitzer. “We just ran it like crazy,” Auberlen said. “I came in for the last pit stop on the lead, and Tom [Milner, head of PTG] wanted to put on super-soft tires just to rub it in.”

After four hours, Auberlen took the checkered flag one lap head of the second-place #43 BMW Motorsport Team Schnitzer car. “That race was very emotional,” Auberlen said. “The only time we had that paint job, it wins. People didn’t know whether to smile or cry.”

Today, the #6 E46 M3 GTR is a treasured part of the BMW Classic USA collection, as is the American flag X5. Both vehicles serve as poignant reminders of the tragedy of 9/11, and the unity of spirit that followed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Road Atlanta. BMW M Motorsport concludes the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship (IMSA series) season with mixed emotions. There was great celebration over the victory of the #48 BMW M4 GT3 EVO from Paul Miller Racing in the GTD PRO class. Dan Harper (GBR), Max Hesse (GER), and Connor De Phillippi (USA) triumphed at Petit Le Mans in Road Atlanta (USA). The victory secured the IMSA Michelin Endurance Cup title for Harper and Hesse. BMW M Team RLL delivered a strong farewell race with the BMW M Hybrid V8 but was denied the deserved result due to a puncture on the #24 car shortly before the finish .

Philipp Eng (AUT), Dries Vanthoor (BEL), and Kevin Magnussen (DEN) were on course for fourth place after a consistently strong race, but around ten minutes before the finish, Eng reported a right-rear tyre puncture. The subsequent pit stop dropped the crew back to ninth place. In the #25 car, Sheldon van der Linde (RSA), Marco Wittmann (GER), and Robin Frijns (NED) finished eleventh. The trio lost touch with the leaders due to two drive-through penalties. The Petit Le Mans marked the final race for BMW M Team RLL with the BMW M Hybrid V8. [ADDRESS] years, 25 victories, and more than 100 podium finishes, the collaboration with BMW M Motorsport comes to an end. Starting in 2026, BMW M Team WRT will take over the racing operations in the GTP class.

In the GTD PRO class, the #48 BMW M4 GT3 EVO crew from Paul Miller Racing delivered a dominant weekend. Harper secured pole position in qualifying for the second consecutive time. During the race, the car led for nearly the entire ten hours and crossed the finish line as a well-deserved winner with a comfortable margin. The victory secured the Endurance Cup title for Harper and Hesse in their debut IMSA season. The #1 sister car fell far behind early in the race due to a technical issue and finished in ninth place. Turner Motorsport, competing in the GTD class, achieved eighth place with Robby Foley, Patrick Gallagher, and Jake Walker (all USA).

Comments after the race:

Andreas Roos, Head of BMW M Motorsport: "Congratulations to Paul Miller Racing, Dan Harper, Max Hesse, and Connor De Phillippi on their fantastic victory, which also secured the Endurance Cup title for Dan and Max. It was truly a perfect race. Unfortunately, things didn’t go as we had hoped in the GTP class. For nine hours and 50 minutes, we were on course for second place in the drivers' standings, which would have been a great result. Then, the #24 car suffered the misfortune of a puncture. The #25 car was set back by two drive-through penalties. Unfortunately, the results don’t reflect our performance. The BMW M Hybrid V8 was strong in the race and had the potential for much better results. This was the final race for BMW M Team RLL with us in the GTP class. I want to sincerely thank the team for their dedication and loyalty over so many years and wish them all the best for the future. A big thank you also to everyone at BMW M Motorsport and to our customer teams, Paul Miller Racing and Turner Motorsport, for a great season."

Philipp Eng (#24 BMW M Hybrid V8, BMW M Team RLL, 9th place): "It’s unbelievable that we suffered a puncture just ten minutes before the finish. We were in a good position, had a strong package, and were on course for fourth place in the race. That would have meant second place in the drivers' standings for Dries and me. It’s really disappointing, but life goes on. A big thank you to Dries for being such an incredible teammate this season. I especially want to thank BMW M Team RLL for eight great years together. Our first race at Daytona in 2018 was my debut in a works programme. Since then, we’ve experienced so much, and I’ve made many friends in the team. That makes this farewell emotional for me. Thanks also to BMW M Motorsport for all the hard work throughout the season."

Sheldon van der Linde (#25 BMW M Hybrid V8, BMW M Team RLL, 11th place): "A tough end to a tough season – that probably sums up our year best. We often had the potential but didn’t manage to put everything together. We’ll take many lessons from this season. We didn’t get everything right, so maybe we didn’t deserve to be at the very top. But 2026 is a new year, and hopefully, we’ll come back stronger."

Dan Harper (#48 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paul Miller Racing, 1st place GTD PRO): "What a fantastic weekend! It started great with pole position – my second in a row. The race was a first for Max and me, and it was great to have Connor with his Petit Le Mans experience on board. All three of us did a flawless job. The car doesn’t have a scratch, which is incredibly important in a long-distance race on such a narrow track with much faster prototypes. The race was a lot of fun, and ending the season with this victory and the Endurance Cup title is amazing. Unfortunately, we had some issues in other races this season, which cost us the chance to win the overall championship."

Max Hesse (#48 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paul Miller Racing, 1st place GTD PRO): "I’m pretty speechless and exhausted after this tough race. Everyone said beforehand that Petit Le Mans is one of the hardest races to win. The fact that we managed to do it on our first attempt is incredible. Winning the Endurance Cup title on top of that crowns this day. Huge thanks to Paul Miller Racing for the perfect job and to BMW M Motorsport for the great car."

Connor De Phillippi (#48 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paul Miller Racing, 1st place GTD PRO): "For me, it was something new and special to race across two cars. Unfortunately, we had technical issues with the #1 car relatively early, so my focus shifted to the #48. The car felt fantastic and was very fast throughout the race. The team also did a flawless job. That’s how you win endurance races."

Istanbul/Munich. Contemporary Istanbul, Türkiye’s leading international art fair, will celebrate its 20th edition from 24–28 September 2025 at Tersane Istanbul. The 2025 edition reflects two decades of growth for the fair, which has become a vital meeting point for collectors, artists, and institutions from across the region and beyond. This year’s fair programme includes a curated selection of galleries from around the world and landmark institutional collaborations. As part of the BMW Art Car World Tour, the very first BMW Art Car, designed by Alexander Calder, and the latest addition to the collection by Julie Mehretu #20 will be exhibited on the ground.

Contemporary Istanbul takes its place on the global stage as part of the ever-expanding BMW Art Car World Tour, a journey that will span continents and continue well into 2026. Marking the 50th anniversary of this iconic series, the tour brings together a constellation of exhibitions across five continents, enriched by a vibrant array of events. With Istanbul now joining the ranks of world capitals and premier cultural gatherings, the city cements its status as a vital hub in the international art landscape. The exhibited Art Cars will be shown side by side for the first time in Türkiye at the BMW Lounge in the partner section of Contemporary Istanbul and reflect the breadth and diversity of the BMW Art Car Collection. A dedicated BMW Art Talk as part of the fair’s CIF Dialogues featuring Head of BMW Group Cultural Engagement Thomas Girst will dive deep into the history and individual anecdotes of the 20 rolling sculptures.

Alexander Calder’s BMW 3.0 CSL laid the foundation for the iconic series when French racing driver and art dealer Hervé Poulain, together with then BMW Head of Motorsport Jochen Neerpasch, asked his artist friend Calder to paint a car. The completely reimagined 3.0 CSL patterned in red, yellow, blue, and white went on to compete in the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1975 and became a crowd favorite. Alexander Calder (1898-1976) was an American sculptor and artist and is regarded as one of the most influential exponents of Classical Modernism. He began his career as an engineer before turning to art. His most famous works are his mobiles – light, free-moving sculptures that are set in motion by air currents or electric motors – and his static, often-monumental metal sculptures known as "stabiles".

The Ethiopian born, New York based abstract painter Julie Mehretu created the latest and 20th car in the collection from a BMW M Hybrid V8 in 2024 where it premiered at the Centre Pompidou in Paris and hit the racetrack at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Space, movement, and energy have always been central motifs in Mehretu's work. For her Art Car design she transformed a two-dimensional image into a three-dimensional representation, with which she succeeded in bringing dynamism into form. Mehretu used the color and form vocabulary of her monumental painting “Everywhen” (2021-2023) as a starting point for her design. Its abstract visual form results from digitally altered photographs, which are superimposed in several layers of dot grids, neon-colored veils, and the black markings characteristic of Mehretu's work.

The BMW Art Car World Tour charts an ambitious course, with stops at prestigious destinations such as Art Basel Hong Kong, Le Mans Classic in France, Belgium’s Zoute Grand Prix, the Shanghai Motor Show in China, and Italy’s Concorso d’Eleganza, among others. Showcasing the collection of 20 iconic BMW Art Cars, the tour serves as a testament to the company’s deep-rooted commitment to global cultural engagement—spanning more than a hundred initiatives across contemporary art, music, film, and design.

Contemporary Istanbul 2025 highlights and institutional collaborations Contemporary Istanbul’s 20th fair edition also deepens its engagement with leading museums and art organisations worldwide. Special presentations will include contributions from the UBS Digital Art Museum (Hamburg), Sigg Art Foundation (Le Castellet), and others, underlining the fair’s commitment to international dialogue.

CI 20 focus: America The fair’s curated Focus Section this year will spotlight the contemporary art scene in the United States, with a particular emphasis on New York. Titled Focus America, the programme will explore the country’s role in shaping global cultural narratives and foster new connections among artists, curators, and collectors. Institutional leaders from major US museums will take part in a series of panels, exhibitions, and networking events.

CIF Dialogues: “Dispersing Coordinates” CIF’s annual conference, “Dialogues”, returns this year under the theme “Dispersing Coordinates: Istanbul and the Shifting Map of Art.” The programme will reflect on global cultural shifts and Istanbul’s evolving position in the art world. Confirmed speakers include Jennifer Stockman (Honorary President, Guggenheim Museum), and Anne Pasternak (Director, Brooklyn Museum).

# GT World Challenge Europe: Weerts and van der Linde celebrate Sprint Cup title in Valencia thriller.
## +++ Charles Weerts and Kelvin van der Linde triumph on Sunday and secure the drivers’ title in the Sprint standings +++ Team WRT once again wins the team title in the Sprint Cup +++ #30 BMW M4 GT3 EVO wins Saturday’s race in the Silver Class +++
Date: 2025-09-21 | Author: Laura Claesgens BMW Group | ID: T0452883EN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Valencia. Charles Weerts (BEL) and Kelvin van der Linde (RSA) have won the drivers’ title in the Sprint Cup of the GT World Challenge Europe. At the Valencia (ESP) season finale, the Team WRT duo in the #32 BMW M4 GT3 EVO triumphed on Sunday and, after a real nail-biting showdown, claimed the Sprint crown. Team WRT also defended the team title in the Sprint Cup.

Weerts and van der Linde had gone into the last of the five Sprint weekends of the GT World Challenge Europe with a 1.5-point lead. However, in Saturday’s race the #32 BMW M4 GT3 EVO was hit by a competitor right at the start and had to retire shortly afterwards. That closed the standings even further, with four teams entering the decisive race within just 4.5 points of each other.

On Sunday, the Belgian-South African duo struck back impressively when van der Linde secured fourth place on the grid in qualifying. With an outstanding stint, the South African fought his way past the competition and handed over the car in the lead to Weerts at the pit stop. Despite intense pressure from behind, the Belgian kept his cool, brought home the second win of the season after a true thriller, and sealed the overall Sprint Cup title.

Team WRT also successfully defended the team title in the Sprint Cup. For Weerts, it was already his fourth Sprint Cup title in GT World Challenge Europe after 2020, 2021 and 2022. For van der Linde, it marked his first overall victory in GT World Challenge Europe.

Their teammates Gilles Stadsbader and Matisse Lismont (both BEL) also had reason to celebrate. On Saturday, they triumphed in the Silver Class with the #30 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, and on Sunday they added a third place in class to secure a double podium finish at Circuit Ricardo Tormo. Maxime Oosten and Mex Jansen (both NED) from Team Paradine Competition also enjoyed two Silver Class podiums: third on Saturday followed by second on Sunday. On Sunday, BMW M works driver Jens Klingmann (GER) and Al Faisal Al Zubair (OMA) from AlManar Racing by WRT also finished second in the Gold Cup with the #777 BMW M4 GT3 EVO.

Comments after the race.

Andreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “What an incredible weekend! Congratulations to Charles Weerts, Kelvin van der Linde and Team WRT on winning the overall Sprint Cup title. After a difficult Saturday, our drivers kept their nerve in a real thriller on Sunday and delivered a fantastic race. I am very happy that they earned the well-deserved reward for a strong season. I’m also delighted about the #30 BMW M4 GT3 EVO victory in the Silver Class on Saturday and the additional podiums by Team WRT and Paradine Competition, who also delivered an impressive weekend. Many thanks to everyone involved.”

Vincent Vosse (Team Principal WRT): “This weekend was an incredible rollercoaster. From the frustration after qualifying and Saturday’s race to the comeback and triumph on Sunday – it just feels fantastic. It was an outstanding team effort. Once again, the team in the pit lane showed how good they are, securing the fastest pit stop overall, and on top of that winning the Pit Stop Challenge championship, is just brilliant. This is our first title with BMW, and we are very proud of it. A huge thank you to everyone! This trophy is well-deserved by the entire team. Now the focus shifts to the FIA WEC race at Fuji!”

Charles Weerts (#32 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT, Sprint Cup Champion 2025): “Overall it was quite a difficult weekend for us. Saturday in particular was tough. We struggled in qualifying, and then had a pretty big hit in the very first lap. I had quite a bit of pain all day and night, which meant I couldn’t recover properly. But Kelvin put in an outstanding qualifying today and his race left me speechless – it was unbelievable. The whole team once again did a fantastic job in the pit stop. After that, I just tried to bring the car home. It was tough going beyond the pain, but of course you do it for a championship. We deserved this, we made no mistakes. Thanks to the team, BMW M Motorsport and Kelvin for this incredible season.”

Kelvin van der Linde (#32 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT, Sprint Cup Champion 2025): “It was a very dramatic final weekend, almost as expected, with a brutal low on Saturday and an incredible high on Sunday. Charles and I grew a lot as a team this year. At the beginning of the season, he helped me a lot in getting used to the BMW M4 GT3 EVO and was very open in helping me to be fast. I am very grateful for that, and it really helped us achieve this result. Over the season, Team WRT won us this championship with their pit stops. Sprint races are hugely influenced by pit stops, and on the weekends when we weren’t the strongest on track, we were incredibly fast in the pits and made the difference there. So, a big thank you to the team.”

# CELEBRATING THE ART OF LACE: ROLLS-ROYCE UNVEILS ONE-OF-ONE PHANTOM DENTELLE
## Rolls-Royce presents a one-of-one Phantom Dentelle, commissioned by a Middle Eastern client as a gift for their father. This deeply personal project was curated through the marque’s Private Office Dubai.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“We always say that inspiration for a motor car commission can be found anywhere, and after more than two decades, our clients constantly prove how true this is. This stunning Phantom Dentelle, commissioned through Private Office Dubai, is an homage to the exquisite handmade lace used in some of the world’s leading haute couture ateliers. Using the medium of embroidery, we translated this delicate material into our pinnacle product, which, in its uniqueness, beauty and craftsmanship, can be regarded as an authentic expression of haute couture.” Michelle Lusby, Private Office Dubai Designer, Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Rolls-Royce presents a one-of-one Phantom Dentelle, commissioned by a Middle Eastern client as a gift for their father. This deeply personal project was curated through the marque’s Private Office Dubai. The inspiration for this subtle and elegant commission was a piece of couture lace. The fabric – delicate lace crafted using a rare ‘Leavers loom’ – featured three-dimensional floral elements and soft pearl-like details. Its intricate textures and gentle palette formed the creative foundation for both the interior and exterior treatment.

INTERIOR SUITE: EXQUISITE EMBROIDERY INSPIRED BY LACE Unique to Phantom, the Gallery runs the full width of the motor car’s fascia and is specifically designed to display a Bespoke artwork. For this one-of-one Phantom, Bespoke designers created a floral composition inspired by couture lace. The embroidery layers multiple stitch techniques, thread densities and tonal blends – including Rose Gold, Sunrise and Oatmeal – to evoke the textures of petals, ferns and lacework. A filigree lace-like base is formed using a triple-run stitch, creating a fine mesh structure. Over this, satin stitch shapes the floral elements with a soft, silk-like sheen, while raised accents echo the original pearl details, catching the light with subtle depth. In total, the piece comprises more than 160,000 stitches. The Waterfall section between the rear seats continues the floral theme with a delicate embroidery echoing the botanical detail in the Gallery design and comprising around 70,000 stitches. The speaker grilles are finished in Rose Gold, subtly complementing the embroidery tones. “The embroidery detailing in the Gallery and rear Waterfall is incredibly complex and designed to capture the soft lustre of pearls. It catches the light as you move around the motor car – or as the sunlight shifts while driving – like the shimmer of a couture gown under flashbulbs on the red carpet. It brings a remarkable sense of movement and theatre to something entirely still.” Brienny Dudley, Interior Trim Centre, Rolls-Royce Motor Cars The interior is completed with Sunrise and Grace White leathers, embroidered ‘RR’ monograms on the front and rear headrests, and Piano White veneer. EXTERIOR COACHWORK: A BESPOKE HUE AND HAND-PAINTED FLOURISH Phantom Dentelle’s exterior is presented in a two-tone Bespoke finish. The lower body is finished in Crystal over Arctic White; the upper body in Crystal over Palais Nemasker Dawn – a colour reserved for the commissioning client’s exclusive use. The double coachline, rendered in Sunrise, resolves with a hand-painted motif depicting a leafy branch with pearl ‘berries’, reflecting the artwork theme inside. The motor car rides on 22” Fully Polished Disc wheels with body-coloured centres and Arctic White centre pinstripes. The polished Pantheon Grille is crowned with the Spirit of Ecstasy in Rose Gold; the same precious metal is used for the Bespoke engraved treadplates. PHANTOM DENTELLE: A PRIVATE OFFICE DUBAI COMMISSION Phantom Dentelle was personally commissioned by the client through Rolls-Royce Private Office Dubai. This invitation-only space brings the Home of Rolls-Royce to clients across the region. At Private Office Dubai, clients have direct, personal access to a Rolls-Royce Bespoke designer and a Client Experience Manager, with whom they can view, discuss, and commission their Bespoke masterpiece in the seclusion and comfort afforded them by the Private Office.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Singapore. BMW Asia today announced the availability of the all-new BMW 216 Gran Coupé, a car that offers the experience of sportiness and elegance to the premium compact segment. Produced at the BMW Group’s plant in Leipzig, the second model generation of the 4-door model now lends even greater emphasis to these hallmark BMW qualities. A clear increase in presence and dynamic performance in the design gives the all-new BMW 216 Gran Coupé a particularly extroverted appearance. An entirely renewed drive portfolio, extensively enhanced suspension technology, and innovative systems for automated driving and parking ensure unique driving pleasure.

"The all-new BMW 216 Gran Coupé is the latest addition to our growing list of CAT A COE offerings in Singapore. With even more options to choose from when browsing for their new car, customers have the freedom to decide what works best for their needs,” said Lars Nielsen, Managing Director, BMW Group Asia. “For those who want something a bit more edgy, the BMW 216 Gran Coupé’s swooping silhouette and frameless side windows will capture attention. However, behind the wheel is where drivers get that true-blue BMW experience – this is the key ingredient that our fans cannot get enough of!”

The progressive character of the all-new BMW 216 Gran Coupé is also evident in its use of digitalisation. The user experience in the redesigned interior is defined by the new BMW iDrive with QuickSelect and a wide range of digital services and in-car gaming based on BMW Operating [ADDRESS].

Sporty elegance in the hallmark style of the BMW brand.

The exterior design of the all-new BMW 216 Gran Coupé is defined by an expressive front section, a dynamically elongated silhouette, and a powerfully designed rear. This conveys even more clearly the sporty elegance that is so characteristic of a BMW Gran Coupé.

The wide BMW radiator grille positioned below the headlights featuring an innovative structure of vertical and diagonal bars inside and the large lower air inlet give the all-new BMW 216 Gran Coupé a low-slung, road-hugging appearance. The standard Adaptive LED headlights come with glare-free matrix high beam, cornering light function, and blue accentuations.

The side view is defined by the long bonnet, short overhangs, and a gently flowing roofline. A pronounced indentation in the transition to the rear emphasises the athletically shaped shoulder section. At the rear of the elegantly elongated side window graphic, a discreetly embossed number 2 highlights the characteristic Hofmeister kink. The rear derives its powerful, modern appearance from an especially ample surface structure broken up by just a few lines and flat lights with a striking notch, and invisibly integrated exhaust tailpipes. Further accentuations for refined dynamic performance are provided by the M Sport package.

The range of exterior finishes includes one solid and ten metallic finishes, of which four are BMW Individual finishes. A contrasting high-gloss black finish for the roof is also optional.

BMW Curved Display and the newly designed gear selector underline the progressive character of the interior.

Newly designed seats provide a high level of comfort on long journeys, with electrically operated Sport seats as standard. The standard sports steering wheel has also been redesigned. This is part of the M Sport package and features shift paddles for manual gear changes. An interaction airbag between the driver and front passenger now contributes to optimised occupant protection as standard. The rear seat backrest offers a 40: 20: 40 split as standard, while the storage volume is 430 litres.

M Sport Package with adaptive M suspension and sport steering.

A standard feature of the all-new BMW 216 Gran Coupé offered as part of the M Sport package, the adaptive M suspension enhances both agility and long-distance comfort by means of variable, mechanically controlled, and frequency-selective shock absorbers. Pressure peaks within the shock absorbers are smoothed out by means of additional valves acting on the traction side. With the Adaptive M suspension, the vehicle is lowered by up to 8 millimetres and includes sports steering.

New generation engine, 7-speed Steptronic transmission as standard.

The all-new BMW 216 Gran Coupé offers a particularly attractive introduction to the world of hallmark BMW driving pleasure.

The standard seven-speed double-clutch Steptronic transmission directs engine power to the front wheels. Accelerating the all-new BMW 216 Gran Coupé from 0 to 100 km/h takes 9.9 seconds.

Improved body rigidity, further developed chassis.

The further refinement of the chassis includes optimised kinematics and new shock absorber technology. The increased caster offset of the front wheels ensures stable straight-line driving and optimised steering feedback. Standard features also include directly controlled wheel slip limitation, an integrated braking system, and 18-inch M light alloy wheels.

# The new BMW M2 CS
## • The new BMW M2 CS further raises the bar for sheer driving pleasure at the premium end of the compact high-performance sports car segment. • Outstanding agility, a significant increase in power output, supreme dynamics and particularly sporty design characteristics make driving the latest exclusive special-edition model from BMW M GmbH an enthralling experience.
Date: 2025-05-28 | Author: Laura Claesgens BMW Group | ID: T0450433EN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The new BMW M2 CS is the next chapter in an emphatic success story, which began with the iconic BMW 2002 turbo and continued with the BMW 1 Series M Coupé and the first BMW M2 – including the first CS variant, which was unveiled in 2019. BMW M GmbH offered a first glimpse of the exterior design of the BMW M2 CS on 23 May, as part of the unique Concorso d'Eleganza Villa d'Este event on the shores of Lake Como.

The new version of this special edition offers the ultimate in driving pleasure – both as a track tool and in day-to-day use. Like the BMW M2 Racing, which is based on the chassis from the latest-generation M2, the BMW M2 CS will be manufactured at BMW Group Plant San Luis Potosí in Mexico. As has become familiar with other special-edition models from BMW M GmbH, the BMW M2 CS will be produced in limited numbers. The key sales markets are the USA, Germany and China. The market launch will begin in late summer 2025.

The new BMW M2 CS is based on the second generation of the BMW M2 and significantly improves what is already an extraordinary level of performance. For example, the high-revving six-cylinder in-line engine with M TwinPower Turbo technology develops an impressive 390 kW/530 hp in the BMW M2 CS. That is 37 kW/50 hp more than in the current BMW M2. As such, the BMW M2 CS matches the performance of the BMW M3 Competition Sedan with M xDrive. The BMW M2 CS sends its power to the rear wheels via the eight-speed M Steptronic transmission with Drivelogic, which comes as standard.

Noticeable weight reduction thanks to intelligent lightweight design

BMW M GmbH has reduced the weight of the special edition by roughly 30 kilograms compared to the standard M2. This has been achieved through modifications including judicious use of lightweight design techniques. For example, the BMW M2 CS features a multitude of exterior and interior components made from carbon-fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP). And it will be fitted as standard with forged M light-alloy wheels. As a result, the CS will be the lightest BMW M2 so far in the current generation.

Upgraded six-cylinder in-line engine with significant increase in power output and torque

For the BMW M2 CS, BMW M GmbH has opted for an upgraded version of the 3.0-litre, six-cylinder in-line engine found in the standard M2. This intensifies the performance experience in the special edition, particularly in highly dynamic driving situations. It further sharpens the engine’s unmistakable power characteristics and perfectly accentuates the linear power delivery – sustained into the higher reaches of the rev range – familiar from M models. Compared to the BMW M2 with standard eight-speed M Steptronic transmission with Drivelogic, maximum torque has been raised by 50 Nm (37 lb-ft) to 650 Nm (479 lb-ft) and is available across a broad rev range – between 2,650 and 5,730 rpm. The engine produces its maximum power output of 390 kW/530 hp at 6,250 rpm, with the engine speed topping out at 7,200 rpm. In order to allow extremely rapid reactions to the driver’s requests for acceleration and to make the improved performance characteristics of the engine a particularly intense experience, the accelerator mapping and response have been optimised in all the drive modes, which are selectable via the M Setup menu.

Racing expertise delivers inspiring performance

With its improved peak performance, the new BMW M2 CS is consolidating its claim to top spot in the compact high-performance segment. This performance specification is achieved by modifying the engine management and provides further proof of the outstanding potential of the six-cylinder in-line engine developed by BMW M GmbH, which also serves as the basis for the power unit used in the BMW M4 GT3 EVO racing car. The engine’s M TwinPower Turbo technology comprises a pair of mono-scroll turbochargers, which each supply three cylinders with compressed air, an indirect intercooler supplied by a low-temperature circuit, and an electronically controlled wastegate. The technology package also includes High Precision Injection, which operates with maximum pressure of 350 bar, VALVETRONIC variable valve timing and Double-VANOS fully variable camshaft timing. The engine also has an array of details borrowed directly from racing car design, including its lightning-fast response, appetite for revs and high-performance capability in track use. These details include an extremely rigid crankcase with a sleeve-free, closed-deck construction, a forged crankshaft with lightweight design, cylinder bores with a wire-arc sprayed iron coating and a 3D-printed core for the cylinder head.

The M-specific cooling system ensures the powertrain components maintain an optimal operating temperature even under heavy loads and the oil circuit is designed to handle extreme dynamic driving situations. A map-controlled oil pump ensures reliable oil supply even under extreme acceleration.

The engine sends its drive power through an eight-speed M Steptronic transmission with Drivelogic as standard. The Drivelogic button integrated into the selector lever makes it possible to alter the transmission’s shift characteristics, with a choice of three clearly distinguishable settings. Both the selector lever in the latest M design and the gearshift paddles on the steering wheel enable sequential interventions in the gear selection process at any time.

BMW M2 CS breaks the four-second barrier

A model-specific engine mounting with a higher spring rate makes for a particularly rigid connection of the drive unit to the structure of the BMW M2 CS. The extremely direct transmission of power to the drivetrain optimises response. Thanks to the lightning-fast power delivery, in combination with the increased engine power and the car’s lighter weight, the BMW M2 CS is able to break the four-second barrier for the sprint from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph). It’s time of 3.8 seconds is 0.2 seconds faster than for the standard M2. The figure calculated using the “1-foot rollout” method** is 3.5 seconds. The increase in power also enhances acceleration from rest to 200 km/h (124 mph). The time required here is reduced by 1.2 seconds to 11.7 seconds – or 11.4 seconds according to the “1‑foot rollout” method**. The mid-range sprint from 80 to 120 km/h (50 – 75 mph) takes 3.4 seconds. The top speed of the special-edition model, which comes with the M Driver’s Package as standard, is electronically limited to 302 km/h (188 mph). The dynamic power delivery is backed by an emotionally rich engine note conjured by the M-specific exhaust system with electrically controlled flaps and the four exhaust pipes typical of M, which come in matt black on the BMW M2 CS. For those wishing to retrofit their car, the M Performance silencer system with carbon and titanium tailpipe trims developed specifically for CS models is available for the first time in the range of M Performance Parts for the BMW M2 CS. The lightweight valve exhaust system with titanium mufflers generates a racing-car sound guaranteed to stir the emotions. The Active Sound Design helps to convey the engine’s soundtrack authentically inside the cabin, with the intensity raised another notch when SPORT or SPORT PLUS mode is selected using the Driving Experience Control switch.

Chassis and brakes optimised for increased performance

The chassis technology and braking system in the BMW M2 CS are precisely tailored to the improved performance characteristics of the engine and the specific weight balance of the special edition. The chassis has been lowered by eight millimetres and adapted specially for the car with bespoke tuning for its springs, dampers and chassis control systems. These modifications improve driving dynamics significantly in all scenarios – including under extremely hard driving. Indeed, the settings for the Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) and M Dynamic Mode have been optimised precisely to meet the demands of driving on the race track. The standard adaptive M chassis has been given a carefully adapted model-specific setup, as have the M Servotronic steering, M Sport differential and the integrated braking system. An M Compound braking system with red brake callipers, which comes as standard, provides powerful retardation. An M Carbon ceramic brake system with red brake callipers is available as an option. Standard equipment also includes CS-exclusive forged M light-alloy wheels with a double-spoke design and matt Gold Bronze finish. They measure 19 inches at the front and 20 inches at the rear axle and are fitted as standard with track tyres, the dimensions of which are 275/35 ZR19 at the front and 285/30 ZR20 at the rear. An ultra-track tyre and a standard sport tyre (a no-cost option) in the same dimensions are available on request.

Exterior features many carbon components and exclusive details

The punchy exterior of the BMW M2 CS is shaped by many components made of carbon-fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP) and other exclusive details. As well as the M exterior mirror caps familiar from the BMW M2, the M Carbon roof – which comes as standard on the special-edition model – and CS-specific rear diffusor are also made from eye-catching exposed carbon fibre. A front splitter in matt black and an exclusive black BMW M kidney grille with optimised air inlets complete the sporty and dynamic look. The lightweight CFRP boot lid with integrated ducktail is a real head-turner. The “M2 CS” logo on the rear has a red outline. Four colours are available for the exterior finish of the new BMW M2 CS: Sapphire Black metallic, BMW Individual Velvet Blue metallic, M Brooklyn Grey metallic and M Portimao Blue metallic. Adaptive LED Headlights with BMW Selective Beam non-dazzling High Beam Assistant and M lights Shadowline with dark inlays are also standard.

Carbon and racing flair continue inside

The interior of the new BMW M2 CS combines an exclusive look with the sporty feel of exquisite Alcantara and innovative lightweight design. For example, the centre console is made of carbon-fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP). The driver and passenger take their places in weight-optimised, heated M Carbon bucket seats with a wide range of electrically controlled settings and an illuminated “CS” logo. The integrated head restraints are removable and, thanks to the option of integrating multi-point harnesses, improve the car’s track readiness. The surfaces of the seats are finished in Merino leather.

With a flat-bottomed rim, gearshift paddles, a red centre marker at 12 o’clock and two M buttons for selecting individually configured vehicle setups, the standard M Alcantara steering wheel – which is available in a heated version as an option and features a three-spoke design – brings authentic racing flair to the cockpit. The trim elements in the instrument panel and centre console come in M Carbon Fibre. Additional specific details include the red “CS” logo on the centre console, the M seatbelts and the entry door sill plates, which are black with an “M2 CS” logo and red outline for the first time. Now illuminated with the “CS” logo, the door trim panels certainly grab the attention. The colour used here can be set individually, likewise the standard ambient lighting. When switched off, a carbon structure is visible. Rounding off the sporty interior is the M Anthracite headlining.

BMW Operating [ADDRESS].5, digital control for the climate functions

Standard equipment in the new BMW M2 CS also includes two-zone automatic climate control, comfort access, the Harman Kardon Surround Sound System and BMW Live Cockpit Professional, including the BMW Maps navigation system. As well as the BMW Head-Up Display, it also includes Augmented View on the control display. The standard smartphone integration allows the use of Apple CarPlay® and Android Auto™. The M-specific displays on the BMW Curved Display and BMW Head-Up Display add to the progressive sports car flair in the cockpit. The fully-digital display grouping consists of a 12.3-inch information display and a 14.9-inch control display. These serve as a platform for the BMW iDrive control and operation system, based on BMW Operating [ADDRESS].5, which can also be used to digitally operate the climate control functions. In the BMW M2 CS, temperature and ventilation settings, heated seats and the heated steering wheel (if specified) can be controlled either by touch using a special menu option in the lower area of the control display or by voice command with the help of the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant.

M-specific operating concept enables direct access for an extensive range of functions

The special-edition model carries over the cutting-edge operating concept for setup customisation from the BMW M2. At the heart is the Setup button on the centre console. This provides direct access to the settings options for the engine, standard adaptive M suspension, M Servotronic steering, integrated braking system working in conjunction with the M Compound brakes, and the M Traction Control function, which allows drivers to set individual intervention thresholds for wheel slip limitation. M Drive Professional makes an ideal companion for journeys fuelled by extra adrenaline. The M mode TRACK and the ten-stage M Traction Control allow customised handling characteristics. The M Drift Analyser shows the angle and duration of drifts executed by the driver, while the M Laptimer is ideal for those striving for the perfect lap.

Semi-automated driving and parking systems fitted as standard include front collision warning, Cruise Control with brake function, Speed Limit Info function with no-overtaking indicator, Lane Departure Warning, and the Parking Assistant with Reversing Assistant. Active Cruise Control with Stop&Go function and the Driving Assistant can be added as optional equipment.

# BMW is once again bringing an exclusive study for a small series to Lake Como this year: The BMW Concept Speedtop
## +++ Exclusive three-door interpretation of a BMW Touring +++ Unique colour and material concept +++ Limited-run small series for collectors and enthusiasts +++

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: This press release is a 1:1 copy of the original issued by BMW headquarters in Germany. No adaptions have been made to cater to the UK market.

Munich/Cernobbio. At the Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este 2025, the renowned celebration of historic vehicles on the shores of Lake Como in Italy, the BMW Group is presenting an exclusive new concept car that will subsequently be made available for purchase in a small series.

The BMW Concept Speedtop reimagines the sporty Touring, blending the elegance of a shooting brake with unique proportions. "A true BMW exudes dynamism and elegance even when it’s standing still," says Adrian van Hooydonk, Head of BMW Group Design. "And that’s also the case with our new concept car. The BMW Concept Speedtop is characterised first of all by its profile. It is very unique in the automotive industry. In this way, we have created an exclamation mark for our entire lineup of vehicles, especially for the Touring models."

The generous interior invites for weekend getaways for two. High-quality materials, the focus on every detail, and the stylistic connection between exterior and interior are a testament for its true craftsmanship.

The BMW Concept Speedtop shares its eye-catching form language with the BMW Skytop and will be offered to collectors and connoisseurs in a strictly limited small series.

Unique profile, dynamic proportions

The pronounced V-shape of the front end, with its shark-nose design, the slim front lights and the illuminated kidney grille give the BMW Concept Speedtop an unmistakable presence. The continuation of the central spline from the bonnet over the roof to the rear spoiler gives the car a dynamic Touring profile. The colour gradient on the roof, moving from “Floating Sunstone Maroon” to “Floating Sundown Silver”, accentuates this shape. The athletic design is enhanced by the car’s broad shoulders. Its elegance is underscored by two-tone, 14-spoke wheels, which have been designed specifically for the BMW Concept Speedtop.

Luxurious craftsmanship

The interior of the BMW Concept Speedtop was designed with a strong focus to even the smallest detail. Skillfully crafted, traditional brogue-style details accentuate the leather-trimmed surfaces and emphasise the manufactory-level craftmanship on display. The two-tone colour and material concept creates a connection between the exterior and interior. The sparkling brown tone of the “Floating Sunstone Maroon” exterior paint is carried over into the interior. Here, the brown "Sundown Maroon" world harmonises with the light "Moonstone White" of the seats. The two-tone leather upholstery divides the dynamic and functional areas of the interior. The visually striking roof spline in the exterior is mirrored as a light beam in the two-tone leather headliner, providing an atmospheric, indirect illumination.

The virtuosity in the design of the BMW Concept Speedtop is further enhanced through the collaboration with the traditional Italian manufacturer Schedoni. Known for the production of exclusive and high-quality leather goods by hand, especially in the automotive sector, Schedoni has always stood for highest quality and customisation. Two storage areas with leather straps behind the seats provide space for two of Schedoni’s made-to-measure bags. The bags were designed exclusively for the Concept to fit in with its colour and material concept. A matching weekend bag can also be accommodated in the trunk.

Most powerful V8 in the portfolio and limited-run small series

The concept car’s engine ensures it scales the heights not only in terms of design, but also performance. It is fitted with the most powerful V8 engine currently offered by BMW.

"Last year, the presentation of the BMW Concept Skytop at the Concorso d'Eleganza Villa d'Este on Lake Como generated great enthusiasm among connoisseurs and automotive enthusiasts," says Bernd Körber, Senior Vice President BMW Brand and Product Management. "This led to a strictly limited production run of 50 units. Thanks to this positive response, this year we have decided to also offer the BMW Concept Speedtop in a limited production series of 70 units. This extraordinary vehicle is now available for order. We are pleased to be able to offer collectors and enthusiasts another exclusive model."

Owings Mills, MD – [ADDRESS], 2025… Akshay Bhatia recorded a hole-in-one during the third round of the 2025 BMW Championship at Caves Valley Golf Club in Owings Mills, MD this afternoon, resulting in BMW’s donation of its seventh Hole-in-One Evans Scholarship. The full, four-year tuition and housing scholarship worth $125,000 will be awarded to a new Evans Scholar in Bhatia’s name next Spring. Bhatia will also take home the 100% electric BMW iX M70 for acing BMW’s signature 227-yard, par-3 17 th hole. BMW guests had a front-row seat for the action as they cheered from the BMW Owner’s Pavilion overlooking the 17 th green.

“It's the coolest thing. It warms my heart that a golf shot that I hit can help a kid get a full scholarship,” said Bhatia, who used a 5-iron to hit his first hole-in one on the PGA TOUR. “This event is amazing when the kids and the caddies get to come walk with us inside the ropes for two days. I just am very blessed and thankful for that opportunity that Evans Scholars provided this week.”

For his effort, Bhatia will receive the keys to a new BMW iX M70, the brand’s first-ever fully electric SUV. With over 600-hp and 811 lb.-ft of torque, Bhatia’s new ride packs as much power as this afternoon’s shot.

“Thanks to Akshay Bhatia’s hole-in-one, everyone wins,” said Sebastian Mackensen, President and CEO, BMW of North America. “Not only will Akshay drive-off in a brand-new BMW iX M70, our exciting electric SUV, but another deserving young caddie will receive a full four-year Evans Scholarship in Bhatia’s name. We couldn’t be happier for him to have hit this hole-in-one on the 17th hole.”

All proceeds from the BMW Championship benefit the Evans Scholars Foundation, which provides full college scholarships to hardworking young caddies with strong academic records. Since 2007, BMW has contributed more than $60 million to the Evans Scholars Foundation, helping over 4,000 young people achieve their educational dreams. Bhatia’s shot marks the seventh time BMW has awarded a Hole-in-One Scholarship. Past recipients include:

“We’re thrilled to use this generous donation to fund a full Evans Scholarship to college and change the life of a deserving young student,” said Steve Colnitis, Chairman of the Western Golf Association, which oversees the Evans Scholars Foundation. “We’re very grateful to BMW as our title sponsor for their continued dedication and commitment to providing educational opportunities to young caddies.”

On Monday, [ADDRESS], BMW Group Member of the Board of Management [EXECUTIVE_OFFICER] joined several dignitaries and officials to mark the opening of an all-new Evans Scholars House at the University of Maryland which will be home to up to 38 new scholars on campus.

# Two anniversaries, one special exhibition: 50 Years of BMW Art Cars and the BMW 3 Series at the BMW Museum.
## BMW Art Car World Tour 2025 will stop off in Munich from 17 June with the legendary BMW Art Cars based on the 3 Series. The BMW Museum in Munich is using a special exhibition taking place as part of the international BMW Art Car World Tour to celebrate the 50-year anniversary of both the legendary BMW Art Car Collection and the iconic BMW 3 Series.

Munich. The BMW Museum in Munich is using a special exhibition taking place as part of the international BMW Art Car World Tour to celebrate the 50-year anniversary of both the legendary BMW Art Car Collection and the iconic BMW 3 Series. The exhibition will open its doors to visitors from 17 June, hot on the heels of the Le [ADDRESS] Hours race weekend. Fittingly, it was at Le Mans in 1975 that the first BMW Art Car – created by Alexander Calder – staged its glittering premiere. The exhibition, which runs until 1 February 2026, will see the BMW Museum present a trio of Art Cars based on the BMW 3 Series: Sandro Chia’s BMW M3 GTR and the BMW M3 (Group A) cars designed by Michael Jagamara Nelson and Ken Done respectively. The exhibition at the BMW Museum – the home of the BMW Art Cars when they are not on display at destinations around the globe – is one of the attractions of the ongoing BMW Art Car World Tour, the largest exhibition project yet in the 50-year history of the collection. The Tour has so far visited 12 markets on five continents, and will continue to showcase the legendary BMW Art Cars across numerous art and car platforms, and at institutes worldwide, over the coming year. The BMW Museum will use the special exhibition to provide insights into the artistic brilliance and history of the BMW Art Car Collection, as well as inviting visitors to explore the technical excellence of the 3 Series and the innovative power of the BMW brand. 50 years of driving pleasure: the BMW 3 Series Since it first hit the roads in 1975, the BMW 3 Series has served as a byword for driving pleasure and a cornerstone for the success of BMW. Across five decades, it has reimagined the concept of the sports sedan, set new standards for performance and put smiles on the faces of millions of drivers around the world. From the groundbreaking first generation to today’s innovative models, the 3 Series has been an enduring, style-defining feature of the automotive landscape. 50 years of “rolling sculptures”: the BMW Art Car Collection Since 1975, renowned artists from countries the world over have gone to work creating BMW Art Cars. The idea was the brainchild of French racing driver and art lover Hervé Poulain, who teamed up with BMW’s then Head of Motorsport Jochen Neerpasch to invite friend and artist Alexander Calder to paint a design onto a car. The result was a BMW 3.0 CSL that competed in the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1975, becoming a darling of the crowd – and marking the birth of the BMW Art Car Collection. Famous names including Frank Stella, Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg, Esther Mahlangu, David Hockney, Jenny Holzer and Ólafur Elíasson have since added further BMW Art Cars bearing their own individual style to the collection. More recently, the American John Baldessari and Chinese multimedia artist Cao Fei used the BMW M6 GTLM and BMW M6 GT3 respectively as a canvas for their takes on the BMW Art Car concept in 2016 and 2017. They therefore joined Jeff Koons and Julie Mehretu in applying their creativity to dynamic racing cars in the last 15 years.

BMW Welt in Munich, 14 March 2025, 08:00 a.m. CET

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Good morning!

SLIDE: BMW Group in Full-Year 2024

As Oliver emphasized, we continue to follow our course and implement our long-term strategy. At the same time, we are focused on our operational business to consistently deliver on what we say.

The BMW Group proved this once again in Q4 2024:

We successfully reduced inventory impacted by the Integrated Braking System or IBS. And we achieved a sequential improvement in retail sales and profit versus Q3.

For the full year, we achieved our revised guidance in all parameters.

As anticipated, we reached peak levels of R&D and capital expenditure in 2024, particularly to prepare for models of the NEUE KLASSE. Starting this year, both the R&D and capex ratios will decrease meaningfully, as we start production of the NEUE KLASSE and lay the foundation for the long-term success of our company with over 40 new and updated models by 2027.

Through our global positioning and the flexibility of our operations, we can adapt to the geopolitical landscape and short-term market dynamics, proving our resilience.

Let’s take a look at the financial figures for the full year.

2024 was a year of two halves:

While the first half-year was in line with our original planning, sales performance in the second half of the year was impacted by delivery stops in connection with IBS, as well as persistent subdued demand in China. As expected, Q4 marked an improvement on the Q3 result.

SLIDE: BMW Group KPIs in FY24

Group revenues totaled 142.4 billion euros. The moderate decrease compared to 2023 was mainly driven by the decline in sales volume and intense price competition in the Chinese market.

Earnings before Tax at Group level amounted to 11 billion euros – significantly under 2023, but as expected in our adjusted guidance. This resulted in a Group EBT Margin of 7.7% for the year.

SLIDE: BMW Group Segment Performance in FY24

If we look at the key financial results of the individual segments:

Automotive delivered an EBIT of 7.89 billion euros and EBIT margin of 6.3%.

Motorrad had an EBIT of 198 million euros, representing a margin of 6.1%.

Financial Services saw an EBT of 2.54 billion euros and a Return on Equity of 15.1%.

And, finally, Other Entities generated 837 million euros in EBT, while eliminations amounted to a negative 146 million euros.

SLIDE: Automotive Retail Units, BEV Units, Auto Revenue and Auto EBIT in FY24

So, let’s take a look at the Automotive Segment in detail:

For the full year, the BMW Group delivered 2.45 million BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce vehicles to customers worldwide. This represents a slight decrease of 4% from the previous year, in line with our adjusted guidance.

Market dynamics in China remain weak, which impacted sales performance. However, the BMW brand achieved growth in every other major region.

In Europe, order intake in Q4 improved month by month. In the US, we experienced a strong recovery from IBS in Q4 with growth quarter-over-quarter of just over 50% and year-over-year of 8.9%.

Worldwide BMW Group sales performance in Q4 saw sequential improvement over Q3. Global deliveries grew by nearly a third quarter-on-quarter including double digit growth coming from the mid- and upper-segment together.

All-electric vehicles remained a key growth driver for us. BEV deliveries totaled over 426,000 units for the year, significantly above 2023 by 13.5%. Overall, BEVs therefore made up 17.4% of total sales.

Our plug-in hybrid vehicles also remained very popular, with over 166,000 units sold in 2024. Electrified vehicles – meaning all-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids – made up nearly a quarter of total sales.

Revenues in the Automotive segment amounted to nearly 125 billion euros, a decrease of 5.6% from 2023.

Earnings before interest and taxes reached 7.9 billion euros. This resulted in an EBIT margin of 6.3%, which was within our adjusted guidance corridor of 6 to 7 percent for the full year.

Excluding the 1.3 billion euros depreciation resulting from the purchase price allocation of BBA, the Automotive EBIT margin came in at 7.4% for the year.

SLIDE: Automotive EBIT Development in FY24

Looking to the operating result in detail:

Compared to 2023, EBIT for full-year 2024 saw a tailwind of 1 billion euros from the net balance of currency and raw material positions.

Year on year, the net effect of volume, model mix and pricing weighed on Automotive EBIT. The headwind resulted partly from the volume decrease, particularly in China. Pricing headwinds, including the effects of a highly competitive Chinese market and dealer compensation in China, amounted to more than half of the overall decrease of 4.4 billion euros.

The headwind of 1.4 billion euros from Other cost changes was driven by inflation in material costs and supply chain support.

The effect from warranty expenses was a tailwind year-on-year. Overall, lower additions to warranty provisions for specific topics were necessary in every quarter throughout 2024 compared to the previous year. An exception was Q3, due to the impact of IBS. For the full year 2024, the P&L impact of quality issues trended in a positive direction year-on-year, as planned.

SLIDE: R&D Expenditure in FY24

SLIDE: Capital Expenditure in FY24

Our R&D activities and investments focused on our ongoing electrification and digitalization strategy across the entire portfolio. As anticipated, R&D and capital expenditure reached peak levels in 2024 – both in absolute terms and in ratio.

Group expenditure for research and development for the full year reached 9.1 billion euros, compared to 7.8 billion euros in 2023. The R&D ratio according to the German Commercial Code was 6.4%, 1.4 percentage points more than in 2023.

Group capital expenditure totaled 9.1 billion euros, an increase from 8.8 billion euros in 2023. This resulted in a capex ratio of 6.4%, compared to 5.7% in 2023.

As we begin to rollout models of the NEUE KLASSE, we will see a decline in R&D and capex. This means in both absolute and relative terms, back towards our strategic corridors of between 4 to 5% for R&D and less than 5% for Capex by 2027 at the latest.

SLIDE: Automotive Segment Free Cash Flow in FY24

Turning to free cash flow – as you know, we steer this on an annual basis.

Starting with EBT delivering a full year result of 7.5 billion euros, working capital contributed positively with 200 million euros to free cash flow. Whilst inventory levels had risen due to sales stops related to IBS in Q3, we managed to successfully reduce stock by 5 billion euros in Q4. As a result, year-end inventory reached nearly the same level as it was at the beginning of the year.

For the full year, the net effect from capital expenditure and depreciation reduced free cash flow by 3.3 billion euros.

The development of provisions reduced free cash flow by 700 million euros.

The position “Other” reflects several positive effects, including interest received.

In line with our adjusted guidance, free cash flow reached 4.9 billion euros in 2024.

This is even after we invested 18.2 billion euros: 9.1 billion euros in CapEx and another 9.1 billion euros in R&D, paving the way for our future, and demonstrating our financial strength.

This strength is underscored by our Automotive net financial assets, which benefitted from the strong development of free cash flow in the fourth quarter. At year end, the Automotive NFA came in at almost 46 billion euros, which is around the same level as the start of the year.

SLIDE: Financial Services Segment in FY24

Moving on to the Financial Services Segment.

New business development in the segment remained robust throughout the year. A total of almost 1.7 million new financing and leasing contracts were concluded, a solid year-on-year increase of nearly 10%.

Overall, new business volume even increased significantly by 12.5% to 64.5 billion euros, due to higher average financing volume per vehicle.

Penetration rates for lease and loan offerings rose by 4.4 percentage points, reaching 42.6%. Without China, the penetration rate was over 50%, with growth in particular in the US and the UK.

Segment earnings before tax amounted to 2.54 million euros and were therefore significantly lower than the previous year. This was mainly due to higher credit and residual value risk costs than in 2023, but well within our expectations. We continue to see gains from the sale of off-lease vehicles, yet at lower levels due to market dynamics.

The credit loss ratio of 0.26% across the entire credit portfolio was well within our expectations and below industry levels.

Return on Equity for the full year reached 15.1%, within our adjusted guidance range of 15 to 18%.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

In our BMW Group Report, you will note that we have voluntarily adopted the full European Sustainability Reporting Standards for the first time as the framework for reporting all sustainability-related disclosures in our combined non-financial statement.

The BMW Group only reports on sustainability topics that have been assessed as “material” according to ESRS. However, this does not mean that topics which are assessed as “not-material” are necessarily less important.

We view sustainability holistically and as a competitive advantage. That is why we disclose our sustainability performance to our investors and customers.

You will note that the implementation of ESRS requirements have contributed over 100 additional pages to our Report. Due to the company-specific materiality assessment, comparability between companies remains limited – even within the same industry.

Indeed, it can be questioned how much value the additional scope and limited comparability offer to stakeholders. Accordingly, we welcome the proposed regulatory changes in the draft of the so-called Omnibus package and look forward to the draft updates and reduced scope of the ESRS.

Ultimately, we want added value for our stakeholders – meaning relevant and concise information. It’s not just about reporting and compliance.

SLIDE: Proposed Dividend and Payout Ratio

One important element of our stakeholder orientation is our shareholder return strategy, which the BMW Group remains committed to.

The Board of Management and the Supervisory Board will propose a dividend of 4.30 euros per share of common stock and 4.32 euros per share of preferred stock to the Annual General Meeting. This results in a total dividend payout of 2.7 billion euros.

The proposed dividend for 2024 represents a payout ratio of 36.7%. This is within our long-term strategic target range of 30-40% and notably higher than the payout ratio in 2023.

On January 2nd, we began the final tranche of our ongoing second share buyback program, which should be completed by latest April 30th. This will conclude the second program – with 2 billion euros – more than half a year earlier than initially planned.

By this point in time, we will have reduced a total of 47 million shares in circulation since the start of the share buyback authorization in 2022. This corresponds to over 7% reduction in share capital.

At the upcoming AGM, the Board of Management of BMW AG plans to propose an agenda item, seeking a new five-year authorization to acquire treasury shares amounting to up to 10 percent of share capital.

You will have noted that we have made a step change in our approach since 2021. Starting in 2022, we added share buybacks as an additional instrument alongside dividend payments. We have also increasingly used the range of dividend payout corridor. And we increased the share of Automotive free cash flow distributed to shareholders from the previous years’ levels to almost 100% this year.

So, let’s move to the Outlook for 2025.

Looking to the market development:

Due to stabilizing inflation and declining interest rates in many countries, we expect to see a rise in demand.

How will the BMW Group’s sales performance develop this year?

Given the robust economic situation, we anticipate a solid market development in the US. In Europe, we do expect growth driven by electrified vehicles. The market dynamics in China, however, will remain challenging.

For the full year, revenues per vehicle in the Automotive segment are expected to be in the same range as 2024.

Our guidance reflects the current status of our planning, including all the tariff increases in force as of March 12th, 2025.

SLIDE: Outlook 2025

What do we expect for our key performance indicators in 2025?

Let me focus on selected guidance parameters.

In the Automotive Segment we are forecasting a slight increase in deliveries of BMW, MINI and Rolls Royce vehicles.

In terms of profitability, the total impact of the tariff increases in place as of March 12th amounts to approximately 1 percentage point on the Auto EBIT margin. As a result, the EBIT margin is now expected between 5 to 7%. Consequently, Return on Capital Employed in the Automotive segment should be within a range of 9 to 13%.

In the Financial Services segment, we anticipate a Return on Equity of 13 to 16%.

The Group’s pre-tax profit is expected to remain at the previous year’s level.

Starting January 1st, 2025, we have adjusted the outlook range for Group EBT guidance. The existing bandwidth was too narrow to reflect the underlying movements in the segments. For details, please refer to the glossary of the BMW Group Report.

The full outlook for 2025 for all key performance indicators is also available in the BMW Group Report.

For the full year 2025, we expect a free cash flow in the Automotive Segment of over 5 billion euros.

SLIDE: Closing

Ladies and Gentlemen,

The BMW Group remains fully focused on achieving our short-term results without compromising our long-term strategic objectives.

We remain committed to our long-term target corridor of 8 to 10% EBIT margin in the Automotive Segment.

To that end, we are constantly enhancing our operational business to ensure we achieve our strategic priorities and optimize our returns.

So, after the peak in 2024, we not only expect to see a turnaround in R&D expenditure and CapEx in 2025, but also a turnaround in operational costs. And here I mean a cost decrease in nominal terms, covering the effects of inflation. This will become visible over the course of the year.

At the BMW Group, strong brands and emotional products have long built the foundation of our success.

With the technological boost from the NEUE KLASSE across the entire portfolio, we look forward to seeing the benefits from our investments start hitting the road later this year.

Woodcliff Lake, NJ – [ADDRESS], 2025… BMW returns as Worldwide Partner for the ultimate faceoff in golf this week during the 45 th Ryder Cup at the Black Course of Bethpage State Park in Farmingdale, NY. Contested [ADDRESS]-28, the legendary biennial team competition pits twelve of America's top players against twelve of the best pros from Europe in a high stakes match play battle. Revered for its display of drama, camaraderie, and sportsmanship, the Ryder Cup delivers an electrifying fan experience that is unparalleled across the golf world. The excitement behind the ropes is just as strong as the energy on the course, making this year’s event the perfect platform to support one of the brand’s most important launches in history—the all-new BMW iX3, fresh off its World Premiere at the IAA Mobility in Munich earlier this month.

Wednesday’s opening ceremony set the stage for a thrilling Ryder Cup weekend, known for its passion and intensity. Across three days, 28 matches will be played—four Foursome and four Fourballs on Friday and Saturday, followed by twelve Singles on Sunday. Europe, led by Luke Donald, needs 14 points to retain the trophy. Keegan Bradley’s U.S. team needs 14.5 and will look to home course advantage to help break Europe’s hold.

For nearly twenty years, BMW’s partnership with the Ryder Cup has demonstrated its longstanding connection to golf at the highest level—a relationship defined by a shared commitment to precision, performance, and excellence. A fleet of more than 200 BMWs will provide premium shuttle service for players, guests, and event officials throughout the week. Fans of golf and the Ultimate Driving Machine will also get a firsthand look at BMW innovation and design through interactive brand displays across Bethpage Black including dueling BMW 7 Series models custom designed by American captain Keegan Bradley and European captain Luke Donald.

Additionally, on the heels of its North American debut in New York City earlier this week, the all-new, BMW iX3 will be highlighted on the 14 th tee. The first model of BMW’s groundbreaking next-generation Neue Klasse previews the future of BMW design, technology, and driving dynamics and ushers in an entirely new era for the Ultimate Driving Machine. The BMW iX3 will arrive in U.S. showrooms toward the middle of next year. In the two years following, BMW will launch 40 new or refreshed models featuring the attributes of the Neue Klasse.

BMW’s journey with the Ryder Cup began in 2006 when it was named Official Car Partner at the K Club in Ireland. The company has maintained a strong presence at each Ryder Cup ever since, both in Europe and the United States. With the American team defending their home turf against a formidable European lineup this year, all eyes will be on Bethpage Black and BMW will be there every step of the way. In between the action on the fairways and greens, guests will be encouraged to showcase their own skills by joining BMW for a unique driving range challenge near the main entrance. Winners will walk away with BMW ball markers, same-day hospitality upgrades, and even the Ultimate Stay & Play golf getaway to Sea Island Resort in Georgia if they’re able to hit the 150-yard target.

BMW Owners can catch all the Ryder Cup action live from their vehicles courtesy of NBC. This viewing experience is offered in models running BMW Operating [ADDRESS].5 in combination with Connected Drive Professional* (excluding the BMW 2 Series Coupé, BMW 3 Series, and BMW 4 Series) and in vehicles with BMW Operating [ADDRESS] paired with BMW Digital Premium. The Ryder Cup will also come to life off the course at the iconic Rockefeller Center in Manhattan, with an official Fan Zone area presented by BMW offering a VIP viewing and lounge area.

Over the past 50 years, BMW has demonstrated a lasting commitment to the game of golf. In addition to the BMW’s support of the Ryder Cup, the company has been the title partner of The BMW Championship for nearly two decades. Since 2007, The BMW Championship has helped raise over $60 million on behalf of the Evans Scholars Foundation, and has provided the opportunity for

more than 4,000 young caddies to attend college. Together, these efforts leave a lasting impact on both the sport of golf and BMW enthusiasts alike.

# BMW Group announces senior management changes in Sales and Finance Divisions
## +++ Jean-Philippe Parain to head MINI +++ Stefan Richmann becomes new Head of Treasury +++ Ritu Chandy to lead Sales Region Asia-Pacific, Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa +++

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Munich. The BMW Group today announced senior management changes in its Sales and Finance Divisions: Jean-Philippe Parain, who currently serves as Head of the Sales Region Asia-Pacific, Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa for the BMW Group, will assume responsibility for the MINI brand as of 1 October 2025.

Parain brings a wealth of international experience to the role and will be tasked with building on MINI's current momentum. Jean-Philippe Parain joined the company in 1997 at BMW France in the marketing department. Jean-Philippe Parain has held several senior management roles including President and CEO BMW Group Belux, Head of MINI Europe and Head of Sales Region Europe. Under his leadership, the Sales Region Asia-Pacific, Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa saw particularly strong growth and reached segment leadership for the premium brands BMW and MINI.

”We are convinced that Jean-Philippe Parain, with his leadership experience and sales expertise, will help MINI build on the strong foundation of the new model family and realise the brand's great potential in coming years,” said [EXECUTIVE_OFFICER], Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, responsible for Customer, Brands and Sales.

Stefan Richmann, currently Head of the MINI brand, will take on the role of Head of Treasury and Investor Relations for the BMW Group, effective 1 October 2025. Under Stefan Richmann's leadership, MINI has seen a strong sales increase by about 25% per August 2025 compared to the previous year, with the new MINI model lineup resonating strongly with customers around the world. Especially the all-electric MINI models saw significant growth during the year.

"Stefan Richmann has done an outstanding job in steering the MINI brand into the future and positioning it for continued growth and success," said [EXECUTIVE_OFFICER].

As Head of BMW Group Treasury, Stefan Richmann will be responsible for the financing activities of the BMW Group, including liquidity management, pension investment and financial risk management.

From 2017, Stefan Richmann served as CFO of BMW North-America and later as Head of BMW Financial Services America. In April 2022, he took over as head of the Corporate Strategy division, and in 2024 as head of the MINI brand.

Ritu Chandy, currently Head of BMW Group Treasury, will succeed Jean-Philippe Parain as Head of the BMW Group Sales Region Asia-Pacific, Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa on 1 October 2025.

Ritu Chandy began her career with the BMW Group in 2001 at BMW Australia and has held senior management roles across BMW Group’s global footprint including CFO for BMW Group Financial Services of North America and CEO of the BMW Group Financial Services Asia-Pacific Region before relocating to Munich in April 2022 for her current position. In this role, Ritu Chandy has driven change in capital market interaction and earned widespread respect with financial market stakeholders for her transparency, strategic approach and unwavering dedication.

“We are confident that Ritu Chandy, with her drive and strength in successfully managing heterogeneous markets, will continue to build on the strong sales performance in the region. I would like to thank Ritu, who has worked tirelessly to strengthen the BMW Group's reputation in the financial market and, together with her teams, has driven forward process improvements in Group Treasury," said Walter Mertl.

Munich. A double title win in the “Best Cars” poll of German car magazine “auto motor und sport” sees BMW celebrating a successful start to 2025. Readers voted the BMW 2 Series Coupé the class winner in the compact segment for the fourth time in succession, with a 13.2 per cent share of the vote. As in the previous year, the BMW X1 took first place in the “Compact SUV/Off-road Vehicle” category. It garnered 8.4 per cent of the votes cast. [ADDRESS],000 readers took part in the 49th edition of the prestigious “Best Cars” awards. From a total of 462 models, they chose one overall winner and one import winner in each of 13 vehicle classes.

Three more current BMW models won awards at the 2025 “Car of the Year Awards” organised by British car magazine “What Car?”. As in the year before, the BMW 4 Series was victorious in the “Best Coupé/Convertible” category. The BMW M3 Touring took “Best Performance Car” honours with its combination of outstanding driving dynamics and great everyday usability. This was another model that repeated its success from the year prior. The “Best Luxury Car” title once again went to the BMW X7, as it did in 2024.

With these latest awards, BMW is continuing the string of successes it achieved in prestigious national and international competitions in 2024, which saw BMW vehicles from a wide range of market segments come out on top in both reader surveys and expert jury decisions.

New BMW 5 Series overall winner of “German Car of the Year” 2025.

At the end of 2024, a jury of 40 motoring journalists crowned the new BMW 5 Series “German Car of the Year”. In doing so, they declared the executive sedan’s latest generation the best new car released on the German car market over the previous twelve months. The new BMW 5 Series Sedan and Touring models particularly impressed the jury with their hallmark driving dynamics combined with long-distance comfort and a wide choice of powertrains. In addition to plug-in hybrids and highly efficient internal combustion engines, the portfolio also includes the all-electric BMW i5 Sedan and BMW i5 Touring models.

But the “German Car of the Year” award was just one of the numerous accolades that the new BMW 5 Series won in the course of 2024. It also came first in the 2024 “World Luxury Car” competition. A jury of around 100 international motoring journalists declared the new BMW 5 Series the winner out of a field of 13 luxury vehicles.

In the UK, “Fleet News” magazine honoured the BMW 5 Series with its “Best Executive Car” title. Renowned British car magazine “Autocar” gave the new BMW 5 Series its “Autocar Award 2024” in the “Best Hybrid” category.

The BMW 3 Series also won a “Golden Steering Wheel”, as “Best Used Car”, in recognition of its outstanding durability. Awarded by German car magazine “Auto Bild” and the weekly “Bild am Sonntag”, this trophy is among the most renowned accolades on the European car market. The “Golden Steering Wheel” winners have been determined annually since 1976, by a jury of experts.

“Auto Bild” and the car valuation company “Schwacke” also crowned the BMW 540d xDrive Touring its “2024 Residuals Champion” (“Wertmeister”). They expect it to experience the lowest depreciation in its class over the next four years.

The success story of the new BMW 5 Series continued in 2024 at the 37th edition of the “Auto Trophy” awards organised by German car magazine “Auto Zeitung”. Readers of the print edition and users of “autozeitung.de” voted it the winner in the “Executive Class/Luxury Class” category. This was not the only accolade for BMW at the 2024 “Auto Trophy” event. The Munich-based premium car manufacturer received a total of eight awards. BMW won the “Auto Trophy” “Best Brand” poll with 22.4 per cent of all votes cast. The new BMW 1 Series came out on top in the “City Cars/Small Cars/Compact Class” segment. With a 26.1 per cent share of the vote, the BMW 3 Series landed a clear victory in the compact executive class. Readers of “Auto Zeitung” were equally impressed with the new BMW X3 and awarded it a commanding first place in the “SUVs from 30,000 to 60,000 euros” category. Finally, the BMW X5 once again won the storied award in the “SUVs from 60,000 euros” price bracket.

Numerous additional awards emphasise the global importance of all-electric BMW models on the international market. In February 2025, the “Automobile Journalists Association of Canada” presented the BMW i4 with the prestigious “Canadian Electric Car of the Year” award for the second time. For the Canadian jury of experts, the inspiring performance and excellent range of the BMW i4’s electric powertrain were as important to their decision as its impressive braking system and the quality of its interior.

In the United States, the BMW i4 made it onto “Car and Driver” magazine’s 2024 “Editors’ Choice” list in the “Electric Car” category. The BMW iX received the renowned publication’s coveted accolade in the “Luxury Electric SUV” segment, while the BMW i7 got the nod in the “Luxury Electric Cars” category. The BMW i4 eDrive40 (combined, WLTP (EnVKV): energy consumption 18.6 kWh/100 km; CO 2 emissions 0 g/km, CO 2 class A) received the “Zero-Emission Vehicle Award” (ZEVAS) as the “Top Compact/Coupé” at the 2024 Los Angeles Auto Show.

Moreover, the 2024 “Auto Trophy Elektro” award for the “Most Sustainable Brand” once again went to BMW, as it did in the year before.

In Denmark, the all-electric BMW i5 won the “Car of the Year 2024” award. Finnish car magazine “Tekniikan Maailma” named the BMW i5 eDrive40 (combined, WLTP (EnVKV): energy consumption 18.0–17.9 kWh/100 km; CO 2 emissions 0 g/km, CO 2 class A) its “Winter Car of the Year” in the “Best BEV Car” segment. And in the 2024 UK “Car of the Year Awards”, the BMW i5 came out on top in the “Best Executive Car” category.

Accolades for the new BMW 3 Series.

The BMW 3 Series won the 2024 “autonis Award” for best new design of the year in the “Compact Executive” bracket. It made first place in the reader’s poll of German car magazine “auto motor und sport”, ahead of the BMW 4 Series Coupé/Gran Coupé. The BMW 3 Series also received further honours on the international stage. In the UK, it was voted “Best Plug-in Hybrid Large Car” by “Diesel&EcoCar” magazine. The same publication also named the BMW 3 Series Touring its “Best Plug-in Hybrid Estate Car”. Another trophy came from the United States. The US car magazine “Car and Driver” included the BMW 3 Series in its 2024 “Editors’ Choice” list, in the “Entry-Luxury Car” category. In 2024, a total of 13 BMW models made it onto the renowned editorial team’s list of recommended vehicles. Meanwhile, the BMW X1 brought home a clear victory in the German “Auto Bild” car magazine’s SUV category for company cars (“Firmenwagen Award 2024”).

BMW collected no fewer than four accolades at the “sport auto Award 2024” event. The annual readers’ poll, organised by car magazine “sport auto” for the past 32 years, saw the BMW Z4 M40i (combined, WLTP (EnVKV): fuel consumption 8.7 litres/100 km; CO 2 emissions 197 g/km, CO 2 class G) win the “Convertibles and Roadsters up to 100,000 euros” category. The most votes in the “Coupés up to 75,000 euros” segment went to the BMW M240i Coupé xDrive (combined, WLTP (EnVKV): fuel consumption 8.8–8.7 litres/100 km; CO 2 emissions 200–199 g/km; CO 2 class G). Readers voting in the “Sedans and Estate Cars up to 100,000 euros” class favoured the BMW M3 Competition (combined, WLTP (EnVKV): fuel consumption 9.8 litres/100 km; CO 2 emissions 224–222 g/km; CO 2 class G) with a resounding 38.3 per cent share. An equally overwhelming victory went to the BMW M4 Competition (combined, WLTP (EnVKV): fuel consumption 9.8 litres/100 km; CO 2 emissions 223–221 g/km, CO 2 class G) in the “Coupés up to 150,000 euros” category.

With the “Paul Pietsch Award”, BMW won one of the most prestigious accolades of the 2024 automotive year. In their vote for the most important automotive innovation of the year, the expert jury of German car magazine “auto motor und sport” chose the BMW Highway Assistant.

# BMW Group sets new climate target for 2035: At least 60 million tons of CO2e savings compared to 2019 – another milestone on the road to net zero
## +++ New milestone on the road to net zero by 2050 +++ Comprehensive decarbonization across the entire life cycle and all drive variants +++
Date: 2025-12-02 | Author: Isabel Richter BMW Group | ID: T0454242EN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Munich, 2 December 2025. The BMW Group has defined a new 2035 milestone for cutting CO 2 e emissions on the road to net zero. The company aims to reduce its CO 2 e emissions by at least 60 million metric tons compared to 2019 levels, an additional reduction of approximately 20 million tons of CO 2 e beyond the existing 2030 target.

In doing so, the BMW Group is pursuing a comprehensive decarbonization strategy along the entire life cycle, with the goal of achieving net zero by 2050 at the latest. This represents a firm commitment to the goals set out in the Paris Agreement. To date, the target has been to cut at least 40 million metric tons of CO 2 e across the entire life cycle (scopes 1, 2 and 3) by 2030 compared to 2019 levels. The new 2035 milestone is a logical next step on this road toward advancing decarbonization. At the same time, the climate impact of the BMW Group’s business model will also be drastically reduced. By 2035, each euro generated will see less than half as much CO 2 e emitted compared to 2019.

The key measures for achieving these results include the increasing use of renewable energies in production and the supply chain, the increased utilization of secondary raw materials, efficiency improvements in the use phase, as well as product and process innovations. The latter are being implemented across all drive variants as part of the BMW Group’s technology-neutral approach. In addition, an increasing proportion of the vehicle fleet will continue to be electrified.

Decarbonization along the entire life cycle

The BMW Group has intentionally set itself the additional 2035 milestone to consistently advance its decarbonization strategy. Global customer demand for electric vehicles alone will not be sufficient to achieve the CO 2 e targets set for 2030 and 2035. The comprehensive approach to reducing CO 2 e emissions therefore spans the entire vehicle life cycle, irrespective of the drive variant.

In the supply chain, which is increasingly relevant in terms of CO 2 e emissions, especially for electric models, the company focuses on expanding the use of secondary raw materials and renewable energies. The specific priorities are highly CO 2 e-emitting components such as high-voltage batteries, aluminum, and steel. In addition, the company will be implementing product and process innovations, such as in the BMW Group’s sixth generation (Gen6) of battery technology.

The BMW Group also applies high standards in production: for example, since 2020, all electricity sourced from external suppliers for all plants worldwide has come exclusively from renewable sources. The BMW Group also works continuously on replacing fossil fuels. The new plant in Debrecen, Hungary, is the BMW Group’s first car factory to produce vehicles without any fossil fuels such as oil and gas in standard operation.

To lower CO 2 e emissions during the use phase, the BMW Group is implementing additional efficiency measures such as BMW EfficientDynamics, in addition to electrifying its vehicle fleet. As a result, efficiency potential in all vehicle subsystems, such as the drive system, tires, and aerodynamics, is consistently identified and implemented, regardless of the drive technology. The new BMW iX3, for instance, uses up to 20% less energy (WLTP combined) than its predecessor.

Reaching the new milestone will also depend on a variety of external factors, such as the transformation of the steel industry in favor of more CO 2 e-reduced steel, the expansion of the charging infrastructure, progress in the circular economy, and the advancement of battery cell technologies. This is why the BMW Group continues to pursue a number of strategic initiatives, such as the ongoing expansion of in-house expertise in state-of-the-art battery cell centers of excellence and innovative circular economy projects.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Capturing the essence of sheer driving pleasure, the new BMW M2 CS sets another benchmark in the compact high-performance sports car segment. Arriving as the latest special edition model from BMW M GmbH, it fuses thrilling performance, superior driving dynamics and a compelling design, whilst continuing a prestigious lineage that began with the legendary BMW 2002 Turbo over half a century ago. With an increased engine power output, model-specific chassis tuning and a lightweight construction – comprising an array of carbon fibre reinforced plastic components (CFRP) – the second-generation BMW M2 CS (combined fuel consumption: 28.8 mpg; combined CO2 emissions: 226 g/km according to WLTP, CO2 class: G) is as proficient on the racetrack as it is on the road. The six-cylinder in-line engine with M TwinPower Turbo technology now delivers an impressive 530 hp – a 50 hp increase over the current-generation BMW M2 – and 650 Nm of torque. As a result, the new BMW M2 CS matches the performance capabilities of both the BMW M3 Competition Saloon with M xDrive (fuel consumption, combined: 27.7 mpg; CO2 emissions, combined: 230 g/km in the WLTP cycle, CO2 class: G) and BMW M4 Coupé with M xDrive (fuel consumption, combined: 28.0 mpg; CO2 emissions, combined: 229 g/km in the WLTP cycle, CO2 class: G), powering from rest to 62 mph in just 3.8 seconds. A range of model-specific design elements give the BMW M2 CS an unmistakeable road presence. Most prominent is a ducktail spoiler which has been seamlessly integrated into the carbon fibre boot lid, alongside exclusive forged M light-alloy wheels finished in Golden Bronze, a unique stripped-back M kidney grille, a newly designed carbon rear diffuser and a matte black front splitter.

*All figures relating to performance, consumption and emissions are provisional. All the stated technical data including fuel consumption and emissions figures relate to the offering in the German market. Dimensions and measurements refer to vehicles with basic configuration in Germany. These may vary depending on the wheel/tyre size and items of optional equipment selected. **Electronically limited. ***Price stated is the Recommended Retail Price which does not include On The Road costs and taxes. Noticeable weight reduction thanks to intelligent lightweight design. The new BMW M2 CS weighs approximately 30 kilograms lighter than the standard model. This notable weight reduction has been achieved through intelligent lightweight construction – utilising an array of exterior and interior components made from CFRP – and standard-fit forged M light-alloy wheels. The result is the lightest BMW M2 of the current generation. Six-cylinder in-line engine with significant increase in power output and torque. The new BMW M2 CS is equipped with an upgraded version of the 3.0-litre, six-cylinder in-line petrol engine found in the current generation BMW M2. Especially noticeable in dynamic driving situations, the engine’s unmistakeable performance characteristics are sharper, and power delivery is linear, even into the higher rev ranges. The engine’s power output rises to 530 hp – a 50 hp power increase over the current generation. Peak torque also sees a 50 Nm increase, with 650 Nm available across a broad rev range from 2,650 rpm and up to 5,730 rpm. The engine’s maximum power output is mobilised at 6,250 rpm before it reaches a 7,200-rpm red line. Performance is further enhanced through model-specific accelerator mapping across all drive modes selectable via the M Setup menu. The engine’s M TwinPower Turbo technology comprises a pair of mono-scroll turbochargers, an indirect intercooler supplied by a low-temperature circuit, and an electronically controlled wastegate. The technology package also includes High Precision Injection, which operates with maximum pressure of 350 bar, VALVETRONIC variable valve timing and Double-VANOS fully variable camshaft timing. Inspired by motorsport, the engine additionally features an extremely rigid crankcase with a sleeve-free, closed-deck construction, a forged crankshaft with lightweight design, cylinder bores with a wire-arc sprayed iron coating and a 3D-printed core for the cylinder head. The M-specific cooling system ensures the powertrain components maintain an optimal operating temperature even under heavy loads, while the oil circuit is adequately equipped to handle highly dynamic driving situations. Additionally, a map-controlled oil pump ensures reliable oil supply even under extreme acceleration. Power is delivered through an eight-speed M Steptronic transmission with Drivelogic as standard. A Drivelogic button is integrated into the gear selector lever, making it possible to alter the transmission’s shift characteristics with a choice of three distinct levels. In addition to the gear selector lever, gearshift paddles on the steering wheel can be used for sequential interventions in the gear selection process at any time. Exceptional performance: 0 to 62 mph in less than four seconds. A specially designed engine mounting with increased spring rates establishes a highly rigid connection between the power unit and the vehicle's structure. This results in a sharper engine response and an extremely direct transmission of power to the drivetrain. Thanks to its rapid power delivery, increased engine power output, and lightweight design, the new BMW M2 CS can accelerate from rest to 62 mph in just 3.8 seconds – 0.2 seconds faster than the current-generation BMW M2. 0 – 124 mph is dealt with in 11.7 seconds, while the mid-range sprint from 50 – 75 mph takes just 3.4 seconds. The top speed of the special edition – which is equipped with the M Driver’s Package as standard – is electronically limited to 188 mph. This dynamic power delivery is complemented by a rich engine note, which is radiated via an M-specific exhaust system with electrically-controlled flaps and – in true M fashion – two pairs of tailpipes finished in matte black. For drivers seeking an even more aggressive soundscape, a lightweight titanium M Performance exhaust system – designed specifically for CS models – is available from the M Performance parts catalogue for the BMW M2 CS. The Active Sound Design inside the cabin also helps to convey the engine’s soundtrack authentically, with the intensity raised when SPORT or SPORT PLUS modes are selected. Chassis and brakes optimised for increased performance. The chassis technology and braking system for the BMW M2 CS are precisely tailored to the model’s improved performance characteristics and its unique weight distribution. Lowered by eight millimetres, the chassis benefits from model-specific adaptations, including bespoke tuning for the springs, dampers and chassis control systems. In addition, the settings for the Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) and M Dynamic Mode have been precisely optimised to meet the demands of driving on track. The M Servotronic steering, M Sport differential and integrated braking system also receive model-specific tuning. An M Compound braking system with red brake callipers is fitted as standard. Driver’s seeking additional stopping power can choose the optional M Carbon ceramic brakes, which are also equipped with red brake callipers. A bold exterior design featuring numerous carbon fibre components. The exterior design of the BMW M2 CS comprises a variety of components made from carbon-fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP) and model-specific details. The front-end is characterised by a newly designed and stripped-back BMW M kidney grille with optimised air inlets, Shadow Line Adaptive LED headlights with high-beam assist and a matte black front splitter. Most prominent at the rear is a large ducktail spoiler, which has been seamlessly integrated into the CFRP boot lid. The “M2 CS” badge finished in a red/black colourway sits beneath the pronounced spoiler. In addition to the M exterior mirror caps – familiar from the current-generation BMW M2 – the special edition gains a standard-fit M carbon roof and a unique rear diffuser, also made from CFRP. BMW M2 CS customers can select from four exterior paint colours: Sapphire Black metallic, M Brooklyn Grey metallic, M Portimao Blue metallic and BMW Individual Velvet Blue metallic. Meanwhile, the CS-exclusive M light-alloy wheels in a double-spoke design are finished exclusively in matte Gold Bronze. They measure 19 inches at the front and 20 inches at the rear (with the dimensions 275/35 ZR19 and 285/30 ZR20 respectively) and are fitted as standard with track tyres. Customers can specify sport tyres at no additional charge, while ultra-track tyres are available optionally and yield maximum performance on track. Carbon and racing flair continues inside the cabin. The interior of the BMW M2 CS combines a performance-oriented cockpit with advanced digital technology and further model-exclusive design elements. A standout feature is the centre console, which has been constructed entirely from CFRP. Similarly, the heated and weight-optimised bucket seats for the driver and front passenger are also made from carbon and can be electrically adjusted into a wide range of positions. Each has integral head restraints, an illuminated “CS” model badge and surfaces in full Merino leather. Bringing authentic racing flair into the cockpit, a heated M Alcantara steering wheel in a three-spoke design is fitted as standard. It features a flat-bottomed rim, a red centre marker in the 12 o’clock position and two M buttons which provide quick access to individually configured vehicle setups. Elsewhere, “CS” lettering decorates the centre console, door sills and is illuminated within the door panels – a unique feature of the M2 CS. Rounding off the interior design is a standard-fit anthracite headliner. M-specific setup buttons for a customisable driving experience. The BMW M2 CS utilises the same cutting-edge operating concept for driving configuration as the BMW M2. At its heart is the Setup button on the centre console, which provides direct access to settings for the engine, chassis, steering and brakes. Offering further customisation capability, the special edition comes as standard with the M Drive Professional system with track-optimised functions such as the M Drift Analyser and M Laptimer. This system also includes a TRACK mode and ten-stage M Traction Control, where the wheel slip limiter intervention thresholds can be tailored to the driver’s individual preference. BMW Curved Display with Operating [ADDRESS].5. The new BMW M2 CS features a BMW Curved Display, comprising a 12.3-inch information display and a 14.9-inch control display with an M-specific interface based on BMW Operating [ADDRESS].5. The information display features M Shift Lights at its upper edge, while the status of the driving stability systems and traction control can be found in the lower portion of the screen. The home screen of the 14.9-inch control display provides access to widgets for vehicle setup, tyre pressure and temperature. A compelling standard specification to enhance driving pleasure. Further standard equipment for the BMW M2 CS includes three-zone automatic air conditioning, comfort access, a Harman Kardon Surround Sound System and BMW Live Cockpit Plus including BMW Maps navigation system. Alongside the head-up display, BMW Live Cockpit Professional also includes an augmented view mode on the control display. Smartphone integration enables both Apple CarPlay® and Android Auto™. Providing partially automated driving and parking capabilities, the Driving Assistant, Parking Assistant, Front Collision Warning, Cruise Control with Braking Function, Speed Limit Info with blind-spot detection and Lane Departure Warning are also offered as standard. Meanwhile, Active Cruise Control with Stop & Go function is available optionally.

# “Just ask Factory Genius!”: How AI helps maintain manufacturing equipment
## +++ AI maintenance assistant Factory Genius speeds up troubleshooting at BMW Group +++ Pilot project at Plant Dingolfing forms basis of company-wide solution +++ Methodology can be transferred to other areas +++
Date: 2025-07-02 | Author: Benedikt Torka BMW Group | ID: T0451072EN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Munich. Whenever vehicle production equipment fails at a BMW Group plant, every minute counts. The maintenance team must work quickly to identify and resolve the cause of the fault. Now, employees can ask the new digital AI assistant, “Factory Genius”, for help: It can suggest solutions for the specific system problem within seconds, reducing the time required for error diagnosis to a minimum. “AI applications have become an integral part of modern production systems and are a key element of the BMW Group’s digital transformation. Factory Genius is an example of how generative AI, in particular, can streamline operations for everyone involved and enhance economic efficiency,” says Michael Ströbel, head of Process Management and Digitalisation, Order to Delivery at the BMW Group. But how exactly does the digital assistant, recently launched in its initial development phase, support maintenance staff? Knowledge discovery tool

The tool essentially works like a search engine, quickly filtering relevant answers to specific user queries from a vast amount of data and user reports. However, this search function does not draw content and information from the internet, but from equipment manuals, quality data, internal fault reports and planning documents it was previously trained on. To keep the data management system up to date, it is regularly fed with new knowledge – for example, in the form of daily-updated shift-log data. By integrating a Large Language Model, similar to those used in chatbots like ChatGPT and Gemini, Factory Genius is also able to understand language: The software can search data for relevant content within the appropriate linguistic context, providing more accurate results than a conventional search engine. In addition to displaying the top matches with links to sources, the assistant can also summarise the maintenance instructions found through contextual search in just a few sentences, if preferred. The user can then ask questions in a chat. Collaborative in-house development

A pilot project in the body shop at BMW Group Plant Dingolfing laid the groundwork for this in-house development. Alongside the tool developed in Dingolfing in spring 2024, other BMW Group locations, including the plants in Spartanburg, USA, and Rosslyn, South Africa, were working at the same time on similar solutions through a transparent process. All were pursuing the same goal: improving access to information when faults occur or during scheduled training and maintenance. AI experts at the company’s Munich headquarters consolidated this expertise, integrating the plants’ diverse requirements to create a company-wide “best of” application. This can now be used globally in its initial development phase through an internal platform.

In addition to search and chat functionality, Factory Genius also features a translation function, enabling it to switch languages at any time to overcome language barriers. This functionality has proven extremely useful while building the new plant in Debrecen, Hungary, for example, since manuals are often not available in Hungarian. Transferable methodology

The technology behind Factory Genius has the potential to be applied to other production use cases as well. The general approach enables integration of a wide range of documents and development of assistants tailored to different user groups. Thanks to its cloud functionality, the tool will also be rapidly available worldwide.

# Robust business model – resilient performance: BMW Group on track to meet full-year targets
## +++ Pre-tax earnings (EBT) of € 5.7 billion secure Group EBT margin of 8.5% at six-month mark +++ Automotive free cash flow of € 2.35 billion in YTD June +++ Automotive Segment EBIT margin in line with annual guidance at 6.2% +++ Significant growth in electrified vehicle sales (+18.6%) in first half of 2025 +++ Record half-year for BMW M models, with 106,000 vehicles delivered (+6.5%) +++ Outlook from Annual Conference confirmed +++
Date: 2025-07-31 | Author: Britta Ullrich BMW Group | ID: T0451620EN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Munich. The BMW Group showed strong resilience in the first half of the year – building on a solid foundation of consistent strategy, robust customer demand, sustained cost discipline and high flexibility. With sales volumes stable at over 1.2 million premium vehicles, and with potential for further growth, the company reported Group earnings before tax of more than € 5.7 billion and an EBT margin of 8.5% in the first six months of 2025.

The Automotive Segment EBIT margin came in at 6.2%, placing it in the upper half of the 5.0-7.0% annual target range, published in March. The segment's free cash flow for the first half-year was € 2.345 billion. At the six-month mark, the BMW Group is therefore on track to meet its targets for the year.

"Our performance in the first half of 2025 once again underscores the robustness of our business model. Our success today, as well as in the future, is based on three strong pillars: our global footprint, our strength in innovation, and our technology-neutral approach with highly attractive products," said [EXECUTIVE_OFFICER], Chairman of the Board of BMW AG . "In September, we will begin a new era for BMW when the first vehicle of the NEUE KLASSE makes its debut at the IAA Mobility. With the BMW iX3*, we are kicking off an unprecedented product ramp-up: by 2027, we will launch more than 40 new and revised models across all segments and drive types. Each vehicle will embody the innovative technology clusters and the new design language. This way, we connect technological advancement and exciting products with strategic foresight and economic efficiency."

By offering different drive technologies and a comprehensive range of models, the premium manufacturer from Munich is able to meet diverse customer preferences, reporting growth across numerous markets: Outside of China, BMW deliveries rose across all sales regions, with the brand recording slight growth of +4.7% .

Benefiting from full availability of the New MINI Family, the British cult brand reported significant growth of 17.4% in the first half of the year, with a total of 133,838 vehicles sold. MINI deliveries increased in all regions of the world.

In Europe , the BMW Group posted solid sales growth of +8.2% , with 498,670 units sold (Q2 deliveries: 256,487 units; +10.2%). In the Americas region, deliveries increased by +3.4% to 237,972 vehicles (Q2: 123,254 units; +1.7%).

Deliveries in the US market rose by +2.7% year-on-year, with a total of 193,826 vehicles delivered to customers (Q2: 98,856 units; +1.4%).

Electrified models and BMW M vehicles with increased sales volumes

With a 26.4% share (Q2: 26.0%) of total sales in the first six months, more than one in four BMW Group vehicles delivered – precisely 319,031 units – was electrified. Europe recorded the highest growth rates for BEVs and PHEVs, at 34,8%.

Alongside electrified vehicles (+6.5%), the high-performance models of the BMW M brand were the main growth drivers for the BMW brand: With nearly 106,000 vehicles sold (+6.5% compared to HY1 2024), BMW M GmbH reported the highest first-half-year sales in its history. The BMW M3* and BMW M3 Touring*, together with the BMW M5* and BMW M5 Touring* introduced at the start of the year, made a significant contribution to this result.

MINI grows with BEV models

MINI’s sales growth also stemmed mainly from MINI BEVs : the MINI Cooper Electric*, the MINI Aceman Electric* and the MINI Countryman Electric*. With a 34.3% share in the first half-year, more than one in three MINIs delivered to customers worldwide was battery-electric.

In the first half of 2025, the Rolls-Royce brand built on the previous year’s strong sales performance, delivering 2,796 handcrafted luxury motor cars to customers (-0.8%). In the second quarter, it increased its sales by +9.4% year-on-year to 1,415 units.

The growing percentage of electrified vehicles confirms the BMW Group's successful approach of offering its customers a broad range of models, all available with different drive technologies. More than 15 fully-electric vehicles and 12 PHEVs are currently available. In the second quarter of 2025, the BMW Group reached a major milestone in its drive train strategy, with the delivery of its 1.5-millionth BEV since the launch of the first BMW i3 in 2013.

Group EBT margin of 8.5% in first half-year

Group revenues for the first half-year totalled € 67,685 million(2024: € 73,558 million/-8.0%; adjusted for currency translation effects: -7.1%; Q2 : € 33,927 million; Q2 2024: € 36,944 million; -8.2%; adjusted for currency translation effects: -5.5%).

Compared with the previous year, revenues were pressured by currency translation headwinds and the expected subdued demand in China. The positive impact of strong growth in new leasing business at BMW Group Financial Services resulted in higher revenue eliminations between segments, which dampened Group revenues.

Following a peak in R&D spending and capital expenditure in 2024, this trend was reversed, as expected, in the first half of the year – without compromising the premium manufacturer's commitment to innovation leadership.

Driven by a strong operating performance, the BMW Group’s expenditure for research and development totalled € 4,020 million in the first six months of the year (2024: € 4,169 million/-3.6%). This figure was down slightly on the previous year, despite intensive preparations for the upcoming models of the NEUE KLASSE, including the BMW iX3 and other successor models. R&D spending focused on digitalisation of the vehicle fleet and electrification across all model series. As planned, administrative and sales expenses were reduced, and capital expenditure for property, plant and equipment also declined.

Between January and June, the BMW Group reported pre-tax earnings (EBT) of € 5,727 million (2024: € 8,023 million/-28.6%; Q2 : € 2,614 million; Q2 2024: € 3,861 million; -32.3%).

The EBT margin for the first half year was 8.5% (2024: 10.9%; in Q2 : 7.7%; Q2 2024: 10.5%). Group net profit for the first half of the year totalled € 4,015 million (2024: € 5,656 million/-29.0%; Q2 : € 1,842 million/-31.9%).

Automotive Segment EBIT margin within annual target range

In the first half of the year, the Automotive Segment generated revenues of € 58,654 million (2024: € 63,009 million/-6.9%; adjusted for currency translation effects: -5.9%; Q2 : € 29,443 million; -8.2%; adjusted for currency translation effects: -5.3%). This year-on-year decrease was mainly due to currency translation headwinds and due to the expected decline in sales revenues in China.

Segment earnings before financial result (EBIT) for the first half-year amounted to € 3,626 million (2024: € 5,394 million/-32.8%; Q2 : € 1,602 million; -40.3%). The EBIT margin came in at 6.2% (2024: 8.6%; Q2: 5.4%). Excluding depreciation and amortisation from the BBA purchase price allocation , the EBIT margin for the first half-year was 7.3% . The impact of tariff increases – particularly the European Commission’s anti-subsidy measures on Chinese BEVs and the sharp rise in US tariff duties – created headwinds in the automotive segment corresponding to the amount of around 1.5%-points of its EBIT margin in the first half-year.

“Even despite higher tariffs, the BMW Group’s business model remains intact – our popular premium vehicles, global competitive strength and high level of resilience provide us with a strong and sustainable foundation. Our footprint in the US is helping us limit the impact of tariffs,” said Walter Mertl, member of the Board of Management responsible for Finance, during the quarterly conference call in Munich. “Thanks to precise financial control, based on calculated forecasts, we are firmly on track to achieve our targets for the year at the six-month mark. Higher efficiency and optimised cost structures also contribute to achieving our financial goals.”

Free cash flow of € 2,345 million in Automotive Segment in YTD June

After six months, free cash flow in the Automotive Segment totalled € 2,345 million (2024: € 2,289 million) and was thus on track for the annual guidance.

The BMW Group is still targeting a free cash flow of > € 5 billion in the Automotive Segment for the full year.

From January to June, capital expenditure for property, plant and equipment and intangible assets amounted to € 2,736 million (2024: € 3,456 million/-20,8%). The capex ratio came in at 4.0% (Q2: 4.5%; HY1 2024: 4.7%; Q2 2024: 5.8%).

Dynamic performance continues in Financial Services Segment

In the Financial Services Segment , dynamic growth in new leasing business continued in the first six months of the year: The volume of new leasing business rose significantly (+9.5%), with the leasing share of total new business increasing to 40.0% (2024: 35.5%/+4.5% percentage points). The segment concluded a total of 824,672 new financing and leasing contracts worldwide in the first half of the year (2024: 849,908 contracts/-3.0%). This represents a slight year-on-year decrease, owing to the lower number of new contracts concluded in China.

The percentage of new BMW Group vehicles leased or financed by the Financial Services Segment reached 43.7% by the end of the reporting period (2024: 41.2%/+2.5 percentage points). Thanks to a higher financed amount per vehicle, the volume of new business remained stable at € 31,893 million in the first half of 2025 (2024: € 31,677 million/+0.7%).

In the six-month period, the Financial Services Segment achieved earnings before tax of € 1,192 million (2024: € 1,481 million/-19.5%). In addition to allocations to provisions, the decline in earnings was primarily driven by lower income from the resale of end-of-lease vehicles in the year-on-year comparison, with the number of such vehicles remaining below the previous year's level.

During the reporting period, the credit loss ratio stood at 0.27% across the entire loan portfolio (2024: 0.25%).

BMW Motorrad half-year EBIT margin reported at 12.0%

In the year to the end of June, BMW Motorrad delivered 105,909 motorcycles and scooters to customers (2024: 113,072 units; -6.3%). The segment EBIT margin came in at 12.0% (2024: 11.6%)

BMW AG continues share repurchase programme

The Annual General Meeting in May 2025 authorised the Board of Management to buy back up to 10% of BMW AG's share capital over the next five years. Based on this new authorisation, the Board of Management has approved a third share repurchase programme with a volume of up to € 2 billion, to be completed no later than 30 April 2027. Acquisition of the first tranche of € 750 million began in May 2025 and will be completed no later than December 2025. This underlines the consistent execution of the company’s shareholder return strategy.

BMW Group on course to meet guidance

The latest forecasts of IMF expect a global economic growth of 3.0% this year – eventually impacted by current trade disputes, the potential for higher inflation and ongoing uncertainties among companies and consumers.

The BMW Group expects increasing demand in many markets in 2025, driven by a stabilizing inflation rate and further moderate interest rate cuts. In China, high competition alongside with significant growth are further forecasted, particularly within the lower price segments.

In the USA, permanent tariffs could manifest in rising inflation. US trade policy and potential countermeasures from other countries may lead to slower global economic development.

The forecast published in the BMW Group Report 2024** in March 2025 took into account all tariff increases that had come into effect by [ADDRESS], 2025. Following the announcements on [ADDRESS], 2025, an agreement between the USA and the EU regarding the customs situation has been reached. Based on this, the BMW Group expects a partial reduction of the currently applicable mutual tariffs for automobiles and production parts from 1 August 2025. Due to the dynamic developments and ongoing negotiations, the expected tariff effects for the current fiscal year can still only be represented through assumptions regarding continuing negotiations. The forecast also includes mitigating measures to dampen the impact of the increased tariffs. In the fiscal year 2025, the BMW Group expects a tariff-related impact of approximately to 1.25 percentage points on the EBIT margin in the Automotive segment.

Given the sustained demand for its attractive premium vehicles, the BMW Group is able to confirm its guidance for the year.

The company expects slight growth in sales, with the share of fully electric vehicles in deliveries rising slightly.

Due to the factors mentioned above, Group earnings before tax are expected to be on a par with the previous year .***The EBIT margin for the Automotive Segment is forecast to be within the range of 5.0-7.0%. RoCE should be between 9-13%.

In the Financial Services Segment, RoE is projected to be between 13-16%.

In the Motorcycles Segment , a slight increase in sales and an EBIT margin within the range of 5.5-7.5%are forecast, with a RoCE of 13-17%.

The above targets will be achieved with the current number of employees .

The BMW Group’s actual business performance may deviate from the expectations described above – for example, due to changes in political and macroeconomic conditions. Earnings risks could arise, among other things, from changes in customs policy, while opportunities lie in a reduction of existing tariffs or their validity period. The company continues to monitor macroeconomic developments very closely.

Deliveries to customers

A new or used vehicle is recorded as a delivery once it is handed over to the end user (which also includes leaseholders under lease contracts with BMW Financial Services). In the US and Canada, end users also include (1) dealers when they designate a vehicle as a service loaner or demonstrator vehicle and (2) dealers and other third parties when they purchase a company vehicle at auction and dealers when they purchase company vehicles directly from the BMW Group. Deliveries may be made by BMW AG, one of its international subsidiaries, a BMW Group retail outlet, or independent third-party dealers. The vast majority of deliveries – and hence the reporting of deliveries to the BMW Group – is made by independent third-party dealers. Retail vehicle deliveries during a given reporting period do not correlate directly to the revenues that the BMW Group recognises in respect of that particular reporting period.

Profit before financial result. Profit before financial result comprises revenues less cost of sales, less selling and administrative expenses and plus/minus net other operating income and expenses.

EBIT margin

Profit/loss before financial result as a percentage of revenues.

EBIT plus financial result.

Profit/loss as a percentage of revenues.

Plug-in-hybrid electric vehicle.

Return on capital employed (RoCE). RoCE in the Automotive and Motorcycles segments is measured on the basis of relevant segment profit before financial result and the average amount of capital employed – at the end of the last five quarters – in the segment concerned. Capital employed corresponds to the sum of all current and non-current operational assets, less liabilities that generally do not incur interest.

Return on equity (RoE). RoE in the Financial Services segment is calculated as segment profit before taxes, divided by the average amount of equity capital – at the end of the last five quarters – attributable to the Financial Services segment.

# Ready for Series Production: BMW Group Achieves Major Breakthrough with Utilization of Natural Fiber Composites.
## +++ Natural fiber composites available for use in series production of future models +++ Reduced CO2e in production with end-of-life consideration +++ BMW M Motorsport applies innovative material technologies
Date: 2025-06-17 | Author: Cornelia Bovensiepen BMW Group | ID: T0450786EN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Munich. Following the successful utilization of renewable raw materials in racing cars, the BMW Group will now harness natural fiber composites also for its series-production models. The BMW Group reached series maturity of #natural fiber composites following several years of development and in-depth research. The composites from renewable raw materials even meet the stringent demands of roof structures in total vehicle homologation.

The flax-based lightweight components have been developed in collaboration with Bcomp, a Swiss clean-tech company, for several years now. The partnership with Bcomp supports the BMW Group’s goal of further reducing CO₂e emissions in future vehicle models. The Munich-based carmaker holds a stake in Bcomp through BMW i Ventures, the company’s venture capital arm.

Lightweight construction has long been a crucial development field for the BMW Group. The use of natural fibers with a reduced CO₂e footprint in composite materials has become increasingly important. Materials tests have demonstrated the fibers’ great suitability, especially for visible exterior and interior components.

One example: Exchanging carbon fiber composites for natural fiber composites in the roof of the next-generation BMW Group portfolio leads to a CO₂e-reduction of around 40% in production plus additional end-of-life considerations.

The innovative reinforcement parts made of natural fiber composites were initially used by BMW M Motorsport in the 2019 season of Formula E. Since then, the components have also been successfully used in the #BMW M4## DTM and #M4 GT4 , replacing carbon fiber plastic (CFRP) parts. Since 2022, Bcomp has been an official BMW M Motorsport partner for the BMW M4 GT4.

The new lightweight materials will soon experience the ultimate performance test as they are fitted in the BMW M4 GT4 for the 24-hour race on the Nürburgring. Franciscus van Meel, CEO of #BMW M GmbH , stated: “Natural fiber composites are a vital element of innovative lightweight solutions in motorsport, allowing for a reduction in CO₂e emissions in the manufacturing process. Natural fiber is an innovation that perfectly exemplifies BMW M’s claim ‘Born on the racetrack. Made for the streets.’. This is why we are delighted to confirm the series maturity of these materials, a breakthrough we achieved with our official #BMW M Motorsport partner Bcomp. We are now looking forward to the use of these materials in future BMW M product ranges.”

# BMW Group Planta Leipzig prepara el camino para conectarse a un ducto de hidrógeno: un hito mundial en la producción de automóviles.
## • Se firmaron contratos con MITNETZ GAS y ONTRAS Gastransport para construir y enlazar la planta con un ducto de hidrógeno.
Date: 2025-10-06 | Author: Jochen Mueller BMW Group | ID: T0453163ES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Leipzig. La planta de BMW Group en Leipzig, Alemania, está preparando su conexión a un ducto de hidrógeno, abriendo la puerta a que sea la primera planta automotriz del mundo en recibir hidrógeno a través de una tubería. Ya se firmaron contratos con MITNETZ GAS GmbH y ONTRAS Gastransport GmbH. El enlace, de aproximadamente 2 kilómetros de longitud, será construido por MITNETZ GAS e incorporará un sistema de presión y medición de gas, conectando eventualmente la planta a la futura red central de hidrógeno. BMW Group y ONTRAS están en proceso de acordar la conexión adecuada a la red de hidrógeno. Se espera que el enlace empiece a entregar hidrógeno a la planta a mediados de 2027.

Una vez que la tubería esté conectada, Leipzig ya no necesitará entregas de hidrógeno por camión, ni en cilindros. “Con el suministro a través del ducto, podremos usar el hidrógeno de formas completamente nuevas, especialmente para nuestros procesos más intensivos en energía, como los hornos de curado en el taller de pintura,” dice Petra Peterhänsel, Directora de BMW Group Planta Leipzig.

En octubre de 2022, Leipzig puso en marcha un quemador de combustión adaptable a diferentes combustibles en su taller de pintura, otro hito mundial en la producción automotriz. Hoy opera un total de once de estos quemadores bivalentes, alimentados de forma flexible con gas natural o hidrógeno.

En 2013, Leipzig también introdujo carretillas elevadoras y locomotoras propulsadas por celdas de combustible de hidrógeno y ahora opera una flota logística interna con más de 230 vehículos de este tipo, la más grande de Europa. Se recargan en nueve estaciones de recarga de hidrógeno ubicadas dentro de los hangares de la planta.

La red central de hidrógeno es un proyecto de infraestructura a nivel nacional en Alemania que consistirá en aproximadamente 9,000 kilómetros de ductos de hidrógeno. Entrará en operación por etapas, con pleno funcionamiento para 2032 y conectando Alemania a la red transregional de hidrógeno.

For half a century, BMW Art Cars have provided a creative platform for renowned artists from across the globe to express their vision on an automobile. The BMW Art Cars by American artists Andy Warhol and Julie Mehretu will be exhibited at this year's Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance. The display at the concours in North America is part of the BMW Art Car World Tour which celebrates the iconic collection in its jubilee year around the globe from Vienna to Hong Kong and Shanghai, from Dubai to Marrakech and Milan. Julie Mehretu’s BMW Art Car will travel on to The Bridge.

Andy Warhol's BMW M1 [ADDRESS] (#4, 1979) Andy Warhol (1928–1987) is considered one of the most influential artists of the modern age and a major proponent of Pop Art. In just 28 minutes, Warhol covered the car – then the latest masterpiece by design legend Giorgio Giugiaro – in colours and textures that clearly reveal his artistic gestures, even today. Hervé Poulain, the founder of the BMW Art Car Collection, witnessed Warhol painting the car and compared it to a live dance performance. Andy Warhol’s Art Car was raced for the first and only time at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1979.

Julie Mehretu's BMW M Hybrid V8 (#20, 2024) Mixed media, print, painting: Julie Mehretu’s works comment on social and political upheavals. Born in 1970 in Addis Ababa and now living in New York, Mehretu is one of the most successful artistic voices of her generation. She first presented her artistically designed BMW M Hybrid V8 to the public at the Centre Pompidou in Paris in May 2024 . After its race deployment in Le Mans a month later, this year marks the next chapter of the project in cooperation with the BMW Group: the African Film and Media Arts Collective (AFMAC) . With BMW Art Car #20 now returning to the artist's homeland for the first time, the presentation at Pebble Beach marks its North American premiere.

At the 74th Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance (17 August 2025) , the signature event of Monterey Car Week, art buffs and motorsport fans alike will be treated to a rare display of these two spectacular examples from BMW’s storied collection.

This year’s event serves as the perfect venue to celebrate two American-made masterpieces, as 2025 marks the 50th anniversaries of the BMW Art Car collection and BMW officially doing business in the USA. The ‘rolling sculpture’ by Julie Mehretu will then continue its journey to The Bridge in Bridgehampton, New York.

In 2016, Bob Rubin, Shamin Abas, and Jeffrey Einhorn founded The Bridge , one of the nation’s most exclusive annual automotive events, held by invitation only on the historic grounds of the original Bridgehampton Race Circuit. The event celebrates the site’s rich racing heritage, showcasing over 200 post-war sports and competition cars. This year, visitors can look forward to a special highlight on 13 September 2025 : Julie Mehretu's BMW Art Car #20 will be on display alongside the McLaren Artura GT4 designed by American artist Mickalene Thomas . Inspired by the idea behind the BMW Art Car Collection, the Driven Artists Racing Team (DART Car) commissioned award-winning multidisciplinary artist Mickalene Thomas to design a custom wrap for their very first race car, the McLaren Artura GT4. The car made its official debut on February 18th at the Classic Car Club Manhattan in New York. The DART initiative was founded by entrepreneur Zoë Barry, art advisor Spring McManus, and professional racecar driver Aurora Straus. It aims to showcase the achievements of women in the traditionally male-dominated fields of art and motorsport.

As part of the presentation of BMW Art Car #20 by Julie Mehretu and Mickalene Thomas' custom-designed McLaren, an Art Talk with Julie Mehretu , entrepreneur Zoë Barry and Thomas Girst , Global Head of BMW Group Cultural Engagement, will take place on 13 September at 4pm . The conversation, moderated by art advisor Spring McManus , explores the innovative fusion of contemporary art and motorsports.

The BMW Art Car Collection. The BMW Art Car initiative came from French racing driver and art dealer Hervé Poulain, who, together with then BMW Head of Motorsport Jochen Neerpasch, asked his artist friend Alexander Calder to paint a car. The result was a completely reimagined BMW 3.0 CSL, which went on to compete in the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1975 and became a crowd favorite. In the years that followed, art icons like Frank Stella, Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg, Esther Mahlangu, David Hockney, Jenny Holzer, Jeff Koons, and Julie Mehretu have enriched the collection, each in their own individual style.

The BMW vehicles that have been turned into works of art using a wide variety of graphic and artistic techniques are as different as the artists themselves – from pure racing thoroughbreds to production vehicles and rare sports cars. The results are all vastly different. No two vehicles are alike. BMW Art Car artists are selected by an independent worldwide jury of museum directors and curators, and the artist always maintains complete creative freedom throughout the entire process.

With its new brand campaign and “Meet Okto the Octopus” video, BMW provides an unusual insight into the operation of its new Heart of Joy central control unit. The star of the video is an octopus performing a perfectly coordinated underwater choreography – as an analogy for the way the Heart of Joy will intelligently coordinate key driving functions in future BMW vehicles, starting with the Neue Klasse models. Munich. A new central control unit called the Heart of Joy is taking BMW driving dynamics to a new level – from standstill to the limits. It will make its debut in the BMW Neue Klasse models. The Heart of Joy combines with the BMW Dynamic Performance Control software stack to centrally control the powertrain, brakes and recuperation as well as some steering functions. Compared to previous systems, the new control unit processes driving information around ten times faster and responds more directly to the driver than ever before. The Heart of Joy passed its first public performance test at Auto Shanghai, as part of the BMW Vision Driving Experience.

The “Meet Okto the Octopus” video translates the new “superbrain’s” power into cinematic poetry. The star of the video is an octopus. A fascinating animal that uses a decentralised nervous system to enable independent control of individual parts of its body. Much like a modern car has separate control units for braking, acceleration and steering. In the new BMW brand video, this scenario is reversed: the octopus is given a central nervous system and then moves in a synchronised, precise and controlled manner to perform an underwater waltz – while simultaneously avoiding hazards.

The video’s concept and implementation are the work of the Jung von Matt Hamburg agency. The video will be shown online and in cinemas worldwide. In case of queries, please contact:

# BMW NA 50th Anniversary | 50 Stories for 50 Years [ADDRESS]: “The Z3 Roadster Phenomenon: Freedom and Fun from Spartanburg”.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the 1930s, the sporty and sophisticated 328 made BMW synonymous with roadsters. Sixty years later, the Z3 made BMW synonymous with roadsters once again, with sporty performance and styling that recalled its legendary predecessor. It became one of BMW’s best-loved cars, bringing new enthusiasts to the marque and inspiring pilgrimages to the factory in South Carolina where it was built.

The Z3 wasn’t BMW’s first roadster of the modern era. That distinction belongs to the Z1, a concept car from BMW Technik that became a surprise hit after it was approved for limited production. Built from 1989 to 1991, the Z1 boasted futuristic styling, an aluminum chassis, and a list price that equated to about $45,000, yet BMW had no trouble selling 8,013 examples in its European markets. The Z1’s success proved the viability of the roadster segment, at least among well-heeled enthusiasts. At the other end of the spectrum, Mazda’s Miata did the same at one-third the price. Following its debut at the 1989 Chicago auto show, the peppy Miata caught on quickly. In 1989, Mazda sold 45,236 of its diminutive Miatas in the US, and in 1990 it sold 95,640 more. While Miatas were flying out of dealer showrooms, BMW designers in Munich were engaged in a styling exercise dubbed “Fun Car.” That prompt inspired 33-year-old Joji Nagashima to sketch a two-seat roadster. “It looked a bit like a 328, a retro design,” Nagashima said. “I don’t think a roadster can be a modern type of car.”

Nagashima’s sketch became a clay model, and then it was selected for further development alongside another concept from BMW Motorrad. The motorcycle division was then led by Dr. Burkhard Göschel, an engineer with a knack for blending tradition with innovation. Motorrad’s roadster took its four-cylinder engine and chassis parts from the E30 3 Series, but it was otherwise unconventional. “It was a basic roadster with detachable door side panels and a detachable trunk cover,” Göschel said. “You could have used it as a roadster pickup!” The success of the Miata had bolstered the business case for a new BMW roadster, which found a strong champion in Dr. Wolfgang Reitzle, then BMW Board Member for Research and Development. In 1992, Reitzle presented three models—Nagashima’s Fun Car and the Motorrad concept, plus one other—to his fellow board members. The board chose Nagashima’s car for its styling and Motorrad’s for its creativity and passion; for production, the two would be combined. Though it wouldn’t be as cheap as a Miata, the Z3 would be built on a limited budget and sold at an affordable price. “I was told to do the car as a ‘first BMW,’ not as a serious sports car,” Nagashima said. “The car was supposed to be a compact, fun-to-drive city commuter for DM 40,000 ($25,000).” Göschel received the same brief. “The approach was unchanged from that of BMW motorcycles. It should be a fun-to-drive, entry-level BMW. Cost should be kept low, since it’s only for fun, and we needed to make it simple and easy to handle.”

“That car pops up, and [Bernd] Pischetsrieder was the Chairman of the Board,” said Carl Flesher, BMW Manufacturing’s first Head of Public Relations. “He said, ‘This looks like what we should be building over there. Adding to the brand, not just repeating what we’re already building. Make it sporty and fun.’ That ended up being the right decision.”

With that, Göschel was put in charge of the entire Z3 project. “I got the whole responsibility of developing the car, setting up production, creating a totally new supply base, and integrating it into BMW,” Göschel said.

The first Z3 rolled off the production line at Spartanburg in September 1995, and two months later it made its public debut in GoldenEye , the first film in which James Bond traded his Aston Martin for a BMW. It was an ingenious bit of product placement negotiated for BMW by Tom McGurn during his stint as BMW’s West Coast Communications Director.

“We had a product placement agent in Southern California, Norm Marshall and Associates,” McGurn said. “One day he asked if I’d been reading that James Bond was coming back after a five-year lag between Bond films. He said, ‘Why don’t we give it a go?’ It was as simple as that.”

The fictional British agent had long been identified with Aston Martin, but the producers were intrigued by the prospect of a switch when McGurn showed them a photo of a BMW roadster concept. “We talked about how it was a new Europe, one in which borders didn’t matter. The European Community had been formed in 1993, and they could use a European car that was going to be built in America.” BMW had never paid for product placement, and the company had no intention of doing so even in a Bond film. “[V.P. of Marketing] Jim McDowell got involved, and we said, ‘We’re not going to spend any money to place the car in the movie, but what we will do is incorporate it into the launch campaign for the car: TV and print, and a number.’” McGurn said. “It was significant enough for them to go ahead with it.” BMW had script approval to ensure the film would express BMW’s brand values, and it wouldn’t be involved in accidents, and the producers accepted the “minor tweaks” McGurn suggested. In the spring of 1995, the Z3 was shipped under wraps to Puerto Rico, where it would be driven by Pierce Brosnan as James Bond. The car was only on screen for a few minutes, but they were good minutes. “It was a bit of a tease strategy,” McGurn said. “We wanted to expose it but not overexpose it, and it was perfect in the driving scenes through lush vegetation, with the top down.”

The film premiered at Radio City Music Hall on [ADDRESS], 1995. The Z3 wouldn’t go on sale until the spring of 1996, but BMW dealers were able to display several show cars while screening the film for their customers. “Most did it, and there was a tremendous number of pre-orders, something like six months of production,” McGurn said. “ Automotive News called it the best product launch in recent history.”

That December, one hundred lucky customers were offered the chance to purchase an exact replica of James Bond’s Z3 1.9—in Atlanta Blue over a Beige Nappa leather interior, and with “007” on the dash plaque and floor mats, but minus the Stinger missiles and parachute installed by Q in the film—from the Neiman Marcus Christmas catalog. “In the first five minutes, they had taken over 200 orders, and we had to immediately stop selling” McDowell said. “I remember going to Panke and saying, ‘Well, our idea worked! It worked a little too well, and now we need 200 of those cars [only 100 Bond edition example were ultimately produced]. It was indicative of the extent to which people were getting excited about what BMW was doing in the United States. I think James Bond's new car really repositioned BMW in people's minds as a great driving car, as a brand that was moving forward, and as a brand that was accelerating.” By the end of 1996, BMW had sold more than 15,000 Z3 roadsters in the US, and the car had inspired a level of devotion not seen since the 2002 erupted onto the scene in 1968. Many who bought Z3s had come to BMW from other marques, but they soon became enamored of the brand as well as the roadster. That year, BMW of North America’s annual sales hit 105,761, topping the 100,000 mark for the first time in company history. In 1997, the Z3 faithful began making pilgrimages to the Spartanburg factory for the annual Z3 Homecomings organized by Amy and Wayne Lester. Amy had been a BMW owner since 1976, when she purchased a slightly used 2002 that she traded for a 3.0 CS a few years later. She restored that car with Wayne, and it still looked showroom-fresh in 1996, when the Lesters drove it to the Euro Auto Festival at BMW Manufacturing’s Zentrum. It attracted the attention of engineers at the factory, and it provided a strong introduction when the Lesters approached communication manager Walt Behnke about holding an event for Z3 owners over Labor Day weekend in 1997. The Lesters didn’t yet own a Z3, but they’d become so obsessed with the car that they formed the Z3 Car Club of America in 1996. “I thought we could get 60 cars, but we had 160 register for it!” Wayne said. They’d promoted it using a new communication tool called the World Wide Web, and a Z3 message board on the Roadfly website.

Where Behnke had assumed the plant would host perhaps two dozen Z3 owners for a plant tour and lunch, it quickly became apparent that a major event was in the works. “We started planning a party and tech sessions to let engineers and assembly workers see how the cars were doing,” said Kenn Sparks, another Communications Manager who served as event host. “We had a couple of clinics to find out what customers liked and didn’t like, finding out that the sun visors were too small, that the gearshift knob could be better quality, etc. The rework guys put on their own clinic, where they could analyze problems and do a quick repair. BMW started to gain tremendous insight from its customers, and the customers loved the attention.” So did BMW’s associates and executives, who were treated like rock stars by those who owned the cars they’d created. “I remember introducing Dr. Göschel to a cafeteria full of happy Z3 owners,” said Flesher. “Once they knew he was there, they all ran out to their cars to get the owner’s manual so he could sign it. He sat there until after midnight and signed them all, then he looked at me and said, ‘Americans!’” The Z3 Homecoming turned into an annual event, renamed the Roadster Homecoming in 2003, when the Z3 was superseded by the Z4 roadster. Well before the last event in 2012, it had become so popular that attendance was capped at 600 cars, and tickets sold out within minutes. “For a long time, it was the largest annual customer event at BMW, and there was nothing else like it anywhere in the world,” Sparks said.

As Homecoming demonstrated, the emotional connection between the Z3 and its owners was profound. “We invited the roadster owners to speak after dinner, and they often told stories about how the little BMW had literally saved their lives,” Sparks said. “One had driven under a tractor trailer in a horrible collision, but was able to get out of the car. We also heard people talk about how much that little car meant to them. One guy had been ill with cancer, and driving his Z3 with the top down helped him overcome it in a way that nothing else had been able to. For those of us in the company, it was a heavy experience, but it was also a tangible demonstration of the value of our work.” The Lesters got a Z3 of their own in time for the second Homecoming: a six-cylinder Z3 2.8i in the rare color known as Sundown. “It was a limited-production color, with only five cars made and only one a 2.8,” Amy said. “We bought that car in 1998, after it had been a factory VIP and press car for about 8,000 miles.” Twenty-six years later, their Sundown Z3 has covered more than 410,000 miles, as acknowledged in a 2021 exhibit at the BMW Museum in Munich. It’s probably the highest-mileage Z3 among the 297,088 Z3 and M roadsters and coupes built, and offers a strong testament to the build quality of the cars produced at Spartanburg right from the start. Likewise, the Z3 and Roadster Homecomings offer strong testament to the affection these cars inspired, for BMW and the plant that built them.

“The Homecoming had an enormous effect all across the US, and it was one of the best marketing events even though it wasn’t actually a marketing event but was totally spontaneous,” Sparks said. “It was absolutely authentic and genuine, and it got customers talking about these BMWs that were made in the US.” —End—

“Uncompromising craftsmanship and meticulous attention to detail have always defined Rolls-Royce. At the very heart of our brand lies a deep commitment to creativity and artisanal excellence. As a name synonymous with perfection, Rolls-Royce holds London Craft Week – a celebration of the finest craftsmanship – as a key moment in our annual calendar. For this year’s event, I am delighted to announce that our highly talented artisans and designers from the Home of Rolls-Royce at Goodwood have created a stunning Bespoke artwork, inspired by the rich and fascinating variety of wildlife in the United Kingdom. This exquisite display of creativity and craftsmanship will be on display at our flagship showroom, in the heart of Mayfair, for the duration of the event in May.” Boris Weletzky, Regional Director, United Kingdom, Europe, and Central Asia, Rolls-Royce Motor Cars

Artisans from the Home of Rolls-Royce at Goodwood have created an exquisite artwork inspired by the rich and remarkable flora and fauna of the British Isles, to celebrate the eleventh year of London Craft Week.

The enchanting woodland scene – a collaboration between makers from the Interior Surface Centre, the Exterior Surface Centre and the Interior Trim Centre – captures the beauty of nature at three moments in time (day, evening and night) as part of a triptych. A Kingfisher has been cleverly depicted in each scene, using different craft techniques to capture the character of the bird during the transition from daytime to nighttime.

Rolls-Royce artisans from the Exterior Surface Centre spent over 100 hours skilfully recreating a tranquil lakeside scene, featuring wildlife, plants and invertebrates that thrive in the aquatic ecosystem. Two elegant swans gliding across the surface of the water, and a Kingfisher hovering above, have been painted using freehand brush techniques. To create the wild reeds that surround the lake, aluminium was cut and painted in Iced Orange Metallic and St Tropez using multiple techniques including airbrushing, wet basecoat manipulation and dappling – a highly realistic effect enhanced by a crystal clear coat giving the impression of morning dew.

ENCHANTED WOODLAND

Craftspeople from the Interior Trim Centre spent over 400 hours recreating the magic of the woodland in the evening. The fascinating variety of wildlife is showcased through the application of different techniques on leather. Delicate flowers resembling daisies were painted onto the Scivaro Grey leather, whilst tactile, hardier flora species were created using a pioneering three-dimensional embroidery technique, whereby thread is layered upon itself to form a self-supporting structure.

Rolls-Royce artisans took further inspiration for the artwork from the animals commonly found in the forest. Hand painted onto leather, the animals portrayed include a graceful hare, featuring long prominent ears and powerful hind legs, and a squirrel with a beautiful bushy tail. To replicate the texture and volume of the tail, a technique called tufting was used in which different materials form pile structures on a backing fabric.

STEALTH AFTER DARK

Rolls-Royce’s specialists from the Interior Surface Centre spent over 500 hours carefully cutting, pressing and assembling beautifully tessellated veneer shapes to capture the magic of the woodland after dark.

In this third portion of the artwork, a fox is depicted padding stealthily into the sylvan scene through the use of intricate marquetry – the art and craft of applying pieces of veneer to a structure to form decorative patterns. In a Rolls-Royce first, the marque’s artisans trialled painted veneers, exquisitely representing the reddish hue of the fox’s fur and its white-tipped tail. Colour has been painstakingly applied to ensure the wood grain can still be admired.

The unique triptych captures the essence of woodland life at three moments in time and is a testament to the marque’s fluency in Bespoke. This captivating artwork will be exhibited in the window of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars London, Berkeley Street, Mayfair, from 12 to 18 May 2025.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nürburgring. Second win of the season, 30th victory of his DTM career: René Rast (GER) had a fantastic Sunday at the fifth race weekend of the season at the Nürburgring (GER). Driving the #33 RoboMarkets BMW M4 GT3 EVO, he stormed from sixth on the grid to the top, earning valuable points to rejoin the title race. Marco Wittmann (GER) already impressed on Saturday with a strong comeback drive, finishing fifth in the #11 Schaeffler BMW M4 GT3 EVO. On Sunday, he started from seventh and finished second, completing the double victory for Schubert Motorsport.

After a disappointing 14th place on Saturday, Rast seemed to be losing touch in the drivers’ standings. He had actually delivered a spectacular comeback drive from 17th on the grid to seventh, but a post-race time penalty following a collision on the first lap dropped him back. Thanks to his commanding victory on Sunday, Rast is now back in the title fight, sitting fourth in the overall standings with 117 points, just 20 points behind the leader. [ADDRESS]-year-old took the lead from sixth on the grid during the first stint and steadily extended it on fresh tyres in the second stint.

Wittmann shone in both races. On Saturday, he climbed nine positions, finishing fifth after starting 14th. On Sunday, a perfect strategy and strong pit stops by the Schubert team secured him a podium finish. It was his second podium of the season, and he now sits seventh in the drivers’ standings with 101 points. Schubert Motorsport holds second place in the team standings with 213 points.

ADAC GT4 Germany: Victory and two podium finishes for the BMW M4 GT4 EVO. BMW M Motorsport teams also celebrated podium finishes at the Nürburgring weekend in the ADAC GT4 Germany. On Sunday, Gabriele Piana (ITA) and BMW M Racing Academy member Berkay Besler (TUR) secured the first win of the season for the BMW M4 GT4 EVO and the FK Performance Motorsport team. The duo claimed a commanding victory from second on the grid. On Saturday, Piana and Besler finished fourth – directly behind two other BMW M4 GT4 EVOs. Thomas Rackl and Linus Hahne (both GER), along with Tim Reiter and Phillip Wiskirchen (both GER), completed a double podium for Team ME Motorsport by finishing second and third. Rackl and Hahne confirmed their strong form with a fourth-place finish on Sunday.

Statements after the race weekend:

Björn Lellmann (Head of Customer Racing at BMW M Motorsport): “A fantastic weekend at the Nürburgring is behind our BMW M Motorsport teams. Schubert Motorsport shone on Sunday with their second one-two finish of the season after Zandvoort, re-entering the title fight in both the drivers’ and team standings after a challenging Saturday race. Equally impressive are the results in the ADAC GT4 Germany. I am absolutely thrilled about the victory for Gabriele Piana and our BMW M Racing Academy member Berkay Besler on Sunday – marking the first win of the season for the BMW M4 GT4 EVO in this series. Alongside FK Performance Motorsport, ME Motorsport also had reason to celebrate on the podium. Getting both cars onto the podium on Saturday was an outstanding achievement. Congratulations and a big thank you to everyone involved!”

Torsten Schubert (Team Principal Schubert Motorsport): “It was a weekend of highs and lows. Of course, we are absolutely thrilled about the one-two victory on Sunday, but unfortunately, on Saturday, we didn’t have the performance we needed and left important points on the table. On Sunday, both drivers were very happy with the cars and were able to work their way from strong starting positions all the way to the top. Looking at the championship, we scored a lot of points here, but we now need to keep fighting. The Sachsenring is coming up next, and it’s a track where we’ve struggled in the past.”

René Rast (#33 RoboMarkets BMW M4 GT3 EVO, R1: 14th place, R2: 1st place): “The victory on Sunday is a fantastic way to wrap up the Nürburgring weekend. I already noticed during the formation lap that my BMW M4 GT3 EVO felt fantastic on the track and had incredible grip. As a result, I was able to attack right from the start of the race and secure a surprisingly commanding victory. I had hoped for a podium, but I didn’t expect the win. Unfortunately, we left some points on the table on Saturday, but thanks to Sunday’s results, I’m back in the title fight. Now it’s on to the Sachsenring, where we’ve traditionally faced some challenges. The goal there will be to maximise the points we can take.”

Marco Wittmann (#11 Schaeffler BMW M4 GT3 EVO, R1: 5th place, R2: 2nd place): “It was a very good weekend, and I’m really happy. Finishing fifth on Saturday from 14th on the grid was already an incredible comeback. Then to top it off today with second place after starting from seventh is fantastic. The team did an outstanding job with the strategy and pit stops, which were the keys to this success. Especially after the zero points at my home event at the Norisring, this weekend comes as a real relief.”

# The BMW M4 CS Edition VR46: Exclusive edition marks BMW M works driver Valentino Rossi’s birthday
## +++ Two characteristic design variants: Sport and Style +++ Each limited to 46 cars +++ Visit to the VR46 Motor Ranch and Misano racetrack forms exclusive highlight +++
Date: 2025-02-25 | Author: Christian Pomp BMW Group | ID: T0448183EN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The #46 is now 46 – and BMW M has the perfect present to mark the birthday of nine-time motorcycle world champion and current BMW M works driver Valentino Rossi (ITA): the BMW M4 CS Edition VR46 (fuel consumption combined: 10.2 l/100 km [27.7 mpg imp]; CO 2 emissions combined: 232 g/km in the WLTP cycle, CO 2 class: G)*. This exclusive edition, produced at BMW Group Plant Dingolfing, is available in two distinctive design variants: Sport and Style. “The Doctor” himself was personally involved in the design process for the two versions, both of which will be built in a limited run of 46 cars. The world-famous number, which is Rossi’s trademark, features prominently in several places on and inside the BMW M4 CS Edition VR46 – for example, on the doors and the roof, which is made of carbon-fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP).

Purchasing a BMW M4 CS Edition VR46 also comes with a once-in-a-lifetime experience comprising an exclusive, personal meeting with Valentino Rossi at his home – the VR46 Motor Ranch in Tavullia (ITA) – and a BMW M Driving Experience at the Misano race circuit (ITA).

"There is no other brand that has motorsport so deeply rooted in its DNA as BMW M. I am proud to be a BMW M works driver, and to share this passion. The fact that there is now a special VR46 edition, in which I was involved from the very beginning of the design process, makes me proud. When I see the BMW M4 CS Edition VR46 out on the road or on the race track later, it will be very cool,” says Valentino Rossi about the edition and the collaboration with BMW M.

Exclusive BMW Individual paint finishes and special exterior and interior details One way in which the BMW M4 CS Edition VR46 differs from the BMW M4 CS (fuel consumption combined: 10.2 l/100 km [27.7 mpg imp]; CO 2 emissions combined: 232 g/km in the WLTP cycle, CO 2 class: G)* is its two exclusive BMW Individual paint finishes, which blend perfectly with the many exposed carbon surfaces, such as the indents in the bonnet. Other distinctive features include a host of exclusive exterior and interior details. The overall colour concept of the two design versions is inspired by Valentino Rossi’s preferred tones and expressive visual style. For example, the “Sport” has a finish in Marina Bay Blue metallic, while both sides of the car display an outsized “46” in the darker Tanzanite Blue metallic. In the “Style” design variant, the bodywork comes in matt Frozen Tanzanite Blue metallic, with the “46” this time in Frozen Marina Bay Blue metallic on both sides. In a nod to Rossi's favoured colour scheme, the BMW M kidney grille outline and one of the V spokes in the forged M light-alloy wheels – which, as on racing cars, indicates the position of the tyre valve – are finished in bright yellow, as are the brake callipers with M logo and an accent strip over the door frames of the “Sport” variant. The carbon-fibre roof – like the sides of the car, painted by hand – is adorned with a large VR46 logo (also in yellow, of course) and Rossi’s signature. The tailgate features VR46 lettering.

The yellow accents continue in the interior of the BMW M4 CS Edition VR46, which is predominantly Night Blue. The M Carbon bucket seats come with Merino leather upholstery in the Black/Night Blue colour combination. The Sao Paulo Yellow of the Alcantara shoulder area creates an exclusive contrast. The head restraints, like the door sill trims, feature a prominent yellow VR46 logo. Furthermore, the M Alcantara steering wheel with three-spoke design and flat-bottomed rim comes with yellow contrast stitching and a yellow centre marker. On the carbon-fibre centre console of all examples of the Edition VR46 is a badge stating “1/46”, identifying each Sport or Style car as one of the limited run.

Six-cylinder in-line engine with 405 kW/550 hp The beating heart of the BMW M4 CS Edition VR46 is a high-revving 3.0-litre, six‑cylinder in-line engine with M TwinPower Turbo technology. This power unit has had track performance as its raison d’être from day one of its development. The increase in the maximum charge pressure of the two mono-scroll turbochargers to 2.1 bar and model-specific tweaks to the engine management mean the edition model’s engine now generates 405 kW/550 hp, which is relayed to the road via an eight-speed M Steptronic transmission, the M xDrive intelligent all-wheel-drive system and the Active M Differential. Lightning-fast power development and optimised traction enable the car to accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h in 3.4 seconds, and from 0 to 200 km/h in 11.1 seconds. When applying the “1-foot rollout” method**, the figures read 3.1 seconds for the sprint from 0 to 100 km/h and 10.8 seconds for 0 to 200 km/h. Acceleration from 80 to 120 km/h takes 2.6 seconds in fourth gear and 3.3 seconds in fifth. The top speed of the edition model, which comes with the M Driver’s Package as standard, is electronically limited to 302 km/h.

Contributing to the excellent engine response is a model-specific engine mounting with increased spring rates. The rigid connection between the power unit and the vehicle’s structure enables particularly direct transmission of its power to the drivetrain every time the driver presses the accelerator. The oil supply system – like the cooling system – is designed to handle the specific challenges of track use, including consistently high revs and extreme lateral acceleration. The engine’s power delivery is accompanied by the emotionally stirring soundtrack generated by the dual-branch exhaust system, which features electrically controlled flaps, a titanium rear silencer with weight-minimising design and – in customary M fashion – two pairs of tailpipes painted in matt black.

Model-specific tuning for chassis technology and control systems The chassis technology for the new BMW M4 CS Edition VR46 has been tuned precisely to the performance characteristics of the engine, the overall vehicle concept and its weight distribution. The individually tuned axle kinematics and bespoke wheel camber settings, dampers, auxiliary springs and anti-roll bars serve to optimise steering precision, transmission of lateral control forces when cornering, spring and damping response, and wheel location. The electronically controlled dampers of the adaptive M suspension likewise come in a model-specific set-up, as do the electromechanical M Servotronic steering with variable ratio, and the integrated braking system.

46 – the trademark of an exceptional racer The number 46 has accompanied Valentino Rossi throughout his extraordinary career as a motorcycle racer and racing driver, and has become even more of a trademark than his nickname “The Doctor” or “Il Dottore”. Having seen his father Graziano Rossi race motorcycles with number 46, Valentino also opted for 46 from the start of his career – and never even swapped it for number 1 when he became world champion, as would have been his right.

Valentino Rossi claimed his first world title in the 125cc class in 1997. Two years later, he added the title in the 250cc class. In 2000, he took the step up to what was the top Grand Prix category, the 500cc class, in which he was crowned world champion in 2001. The following year, this category was replaced by the MotoGP class, and Rossi remained the dominant force. By 2005 he had added a further four world titles, and numbers eight and nine were to follow in 2008 and 2009. With these nine world championships and no fewer than 115 Grand Prix victories to his name, he is one of the three most successful motorcycle racers in history and a global motor sport and style icon. VR46 has become a worldwide trademark – and Rossi’s home town of Tavullia has even reduced its speed limit from the usual 50 km/h to 46 km/h in his honour.

BMW M works driver since the start of 2023 When the curtain fell on his motorcycle career at the finale to the 2021 season, Valentino Rossi turned his attention solely to car racing, having already attended multiple tests in [ADDRESS] race cars and made guest appearances in rallies and endurance races. Since the start of the 2023 season, he has been a BMW M works driver, plying his trade at the wheel of a BMW M4 GT3 for BMW M Team WRT in series including the GT World Challenge Europe and the FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC) – which includes the 24 Hours of Le Mans (FRA). At the start of February 2025, he finished runner-up in a BMW M4 GT3 at the [ADDRESS] Hour (AUS), the opening round of this season’s Intercontinental GT Challenge (IGTC).

Exclusive meeting with Valentino Rossi in Italy An exclusive bonus that comes with purchasing a BMW M4 CS Edition VR46 is the opportunity to enjoy a very special two-day experience in Italy. Day one features a visit to the VR46 Motor Ranch in Tavullia, including a barbecue and a chance to talk shop with Valentino Rossi himself. On day two, you will head to the Misano World Circuit Marco Simoncelli for a special BMW M Driving Experience with the latest BMW M models. Rossi, at the wheel of a BMW M4 GT3, won GT World Challenge Europe Sprint Cup races at his home circuit in both 2023 and 2024.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Austin. What initially seemed like a frustrating race for BMW M Motorsport turned into a podium celebration in the LMGT3 class during a spectacular final stage. At the "Lone Star Le Mans”, the sixth round of the FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC) at the Circuit of the Americas, Ahmad Al Harthy (OMA), Valentino Rossi (ITA), and Kelvin van der Linde (RSA) secured second place on the podium in the Team WRT #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO. In the Hypercar category, the BMW M Hybrid V8 fell significantly short of expectations. After six hours of racing, the #15 car finished in a disappointing twelfth place, while the sister car retired due to technical issues.

Race week, which began with nearly 40-degree heat, turned into a wet event by the weekend. The track was already damp during qualifying, but the #15 BMW M Hybrid V8 and both BMW M4 GT3 EVOs managed to secure spots in Hyperpole. However, none of the cars were initially able to capitalise on their strong starting positions during the race on the wet track. The #15 BMW M Hybrid V8 struggled with the conditions and was unable to generate the necessary grip on wet tyres for competitive lap times at any point. In the end, it finished in a disappointing twelfth place. The #20 Shell BMW M Hybrid V8 retired early due to an electronics issue with the hybrid system.

The two BMW M4 GT3 EVOs started from fourth and ninth on the grid. They also faced challenges in the heavy rain but made a remarkable comeback in the final stage as the track began to dry. Final drivers van der Linde and Farfus gained position after position on slicks, climbing to third and fourth in the closing minutes of the race. Following post-race time penalties, the #46 car was promoted to second place, while the #31 car dropped to ninth after Farfus received a penalty for a collision with a Hypercar.

Comments after the race:

Andreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): "What a turn of events in the final 30 minutes of the race! Congratulations to both LMGT3 crews for their spot-on strategic decisions and thrilling comebacks. The podium finish for car #46 is fantastic, though the post-race penalty slightly dampens the equally strong performance of the #31. Nevertheless, this is a satisfying conclusion to what had been a frustrating weekend up to that point. On the Hypercar side, we struggled significantly with the wet conditions during the race and were unable to showcase the potential we had demonstrated in practice sessions. That is very disappointing, as is the early technical failure for the #20 BMW M Hybrid V8. What happened today requires a very self-critical analysis. We need to be better prepared at Fuji and make more of the opportunities available to us."

Vincent Vosse (Team Principal, BMW M Team WRT): "On the Hypercar side, the weekend was very disappointing. We haven’t had much experience driving in such wet conditions, and it’s clear we still have a lot to learn in this area. We need to carefully analyse why we were unable to deliver any performance with the #15 car. The same applies to the hybrid system issue on the #20 car. On the GT3 side, the race was a rollercoaster. The podium finish for the #46 car allows us to look back on the race weekend with a smile."

Raffaele Marciello (BMW M Team WRT, #15 BMW M Hybrid V8, 12th place): “This is not the race we wanted. We really struggled out there. Now we need to analyse and understand why we were so slow under these conditions today.”

René Rast (BMW M Team WRT, #20 Shell BMW M Hybrid V8, DNF): “It’s frustrating not to even be able to properly start the race. I think we had a good package and could have scored a lot of points here, but that’s how motorsport is sometimes. Now we have to focus on Fuji and try to get back on the podium there.”

Kelvin van der Linde (Team WRT, #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, 2nd place): “This is a fantastic result for everyone, especially considering the issues we’ve had with pace over the past three weekends. These conditions were perfect for the car. We’re all very happy and proud; the team did an amazing job.”

Valentino Rossi (Team WRT, #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, 2nd place): “This is incredible. I’m very happy with this podium – especially for the team. We had our struggles during the race and were even at the back at one point, but a race isn’t over until the checkered flag. Our car was unbelievably strong on slicks on the drying track at the end, and Kelvin did a fantastic job.”

Ahmad Al Harthy (Team WRT, #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, 2nd place): “This weekend was a rollercoaster. You should never give up, and we didn’t. We fought until the very last lap. The podium is a well-deserved reward for the entire team. It’s been a while since we’ve been up there. For me personally, it’s my first podium in the USA.”

Augusto Farfus (The Bend Team WRT, #31 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, 9th place): “That was a very challenging race. We didn’t expect to finish in third and fourth, which later turned into second and ninth. The team did an amazing job. Congratulations to the #46 crew on the podium. I received a penalty for the contact with the Ferrari Hypercar. It was an unfortunate situation and by no means intentional. Something like that can happen in such a tight corner on a slippery track.”

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Estoril. Two more victories on the road to the riders’ world championship title and important points for the manufacturers’ battle – Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR), BMW Motorrad Motorsport, and the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team once again shone at Estoril. The penultimate round of the 2025 FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) took place at the Portuguese circuit near Lisbon. Riding his #1 BMW M 1000 RR, Razgatlioglu won both the first main race and the Superpole race, and added a second-place podium finish in race two. He also set new lap records over the weekend. As the leader of the riders’ standings, “El Turco” now heads to the season finale at Jerez de la Frontera (ESP) with a 39-point lead over his closest rival Nicolò Bulega (ITA / Ducati).

Teammate Michael van der Mark (NED) also showed strong form at Estoril. In Saturday’s first race, he was caught up in a multi-rider incident at the first corner through no fault of his own. He was able to take part in the restart but faced technical issues and finished 15th. In the Superpole race, he secured an important ninth place to improve his grid position for race two, where he finished tenth – once again inside the top ten.

In the manufacturers’ standings, BMW remains hot on the heels of leaders Ducati, trailing by just three points ahead of the final round. A total of 62 points will still be up for grabs in the last three races of the season at Jerez de la Frontera.

Reactions after the Estoril round.

Sven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “It was another important step towards the title and an almost perfect weekend for us. With two victories and a second place, we can now travel to Jerez with a very solid points advantage. Toprak’s performance was once again outstanding. At the same time, Nicolò Bulega’s performance also deserves recognition. What those two showed in the races, pulling away from the rest of the field, was on another level. We are also very happy with Mickey’s performance; he did a great job with his top-ten results. I think he too is ready for his, for now, last race weekend in WorldSBK. We will now do everything we can – in Berlin, Munich, England, and at the track – to be as well prepared as possible, and we’re looking forward to the season finale.”

Christian Gonschor, Technical Director BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “It was another fantastic weekend with two wins, pole position, lap records, and a second place. With this tremendous weekend, Toprak extended his lead in the riders’ championship – a maximum success that the entire team can be proud of. Toprak showed his professionalism in every race, and in the second main race he knew that second place was also crucial for the championship, for the big goal. He didn’t take any unnecessary risks to go for the win. Looking ahead to Jerez, we are excited for an intense finale, and we want to express our gratitude to the organisers and the FIM, whose control and regulatory mechanisms ensure fair competition that thrills fans at the track and on TV with two magnificent riders at the front.”

Toprak Razgatlioglu, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “I was really happy to win the first race. At the beginning, all was under control but then Nicolò had a bit more grip than me. At the end of the race I was spinning a lot but he was too. In the Superpole race, the start was a bit difficult, I was fighting with Nicolò on the first two laps. But then I just focused on my pace, pushing for a good lap time and trying to not make any mistake. So in the end I won again. Race two was more difficult for me. I was back in fifth, had to overtake but just focused on my job to catch Nicolò. When I was back in second place I was pushing so hard on every lap that the rear tyre dropped, so I was struggling a lot. I had to start to manage my race and I just thought: ‘Okay, this time it is impossible to win, P2 is enough because I need the good points for the championship.’ Now I am looking forward to Jerez. We have some margin in the championship, and everything else we will see there. Nicolò is very strong at Jerez but I will try to do my best again.”

Michael van der Mark, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “At the last couple of rounds we had a great feeling with the bike and then we came here and for some reason we struggled quite a lot with the bike in the beginning. We couldn’t get the right feeling and not the right speed on Friday. For Saturday morning, we improved our pace and our package a lot. I was confident for Superpole but unfortunately I lost a lot of time by missing a gear. Especially here you lose a lot of places on the grid and P12 was not fantastic. In race one, I had a good start, but unfortunately someone crashed in turn one and took me out. The guys in the pit box made sure that the spare bike was ready and I was able to do the re-start. After a few good laps I unfortunately had a technical issue. I managed to finish the race and score one point, but it was a very disappointing Saturday. In Sunday’s Superpole race we decided to go with the race tyre as we felt that the qualifying tyre was a big risk. I finished P9 which was not too bad. It was good to move up on the grid, especially for turn one. My start in race two was not great but I had a good pace. I was catching up with the guys in front of me, but I just seemed to struggle a bit with the bike when I got really close to them. I was fighting hard and finished tenth collecting more points. Now I’m looking forward to Jerez, especially in regards of the championship. It looks like Toprak will win it there, so that’s the thing everyone is looking out for.”

# Where it all comes together: What does a data scientist do in high-voltage battery production?
## +++ Artificial intelligence and data analytics in high-voltage battery production +++ AI-supported quality assurance for zero-defect manufacturing approach +++ An interview with Patrick Zimmermann, data scientist and IT project manager +++
Date: 2025-08-18 | Author: Christian Marxt BMW Group | ID: T0451917EN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Munich. The high-voltage battery is a vital component of every electric vehicle. With the high-voltage batteries for the sixth generation (Gen6) of BMW eDrive, the BMW Group has made a big step in technology, delivering major improvements in energy density, charging speed and range. In readiness for series production, the BMW Group is currently building five assembly sites across three continents: in Irlbach-Straßkirchen (Lower Bavaria), Debrecen (Hungary), Shenyang (China), San Luis Potosí (Mexico) and Woodruff (USA). Before the series launch, production processes will be developed and tested at the BMW Group’s pilot plants for high-voltage batteries in Parsdorf and Hallbergmoos, and at the Research and Innovation Centre (FIZ) in Munich. As a data scientist and IT project manager, Patrick Zimmermann is responsible for implementing the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and data analytics in the high-voltage battery production of the BMW Group. His role is to weave all relevant software strands together.

Patrick, what do you do as a data scientist and IT project manager in high-voltage battery production?

Patrick Zimmermann (PZ): I coordinate an interdisciplinary team that oversees the entire data processing chain: from data provision at the manufacturing facilities to edge applications that transfer our production data to the cloud and to analytics platforms.

What kind of expertise do you need for that?

PZ: First and foremost, the job requires a solid understanding of the technologies used to manufacture our high-voltage batteries. For this latest generation, which uses the new cylindrical round cells, we’ve developed a completely new production process. Of course, strong IT knowledge is also essential – with a clear focus on the software architectures behind the data analytics and artificial intelligence. Understanding the individual software modules and interfaces is crucial for choosing the right solutions for our production from the wide range of technologies and applications available.

This means you always have your finger on the pulse and can anticipate IT trends?

PZ: Data analytics and AI for production are evolving at a tremendous pace right now. That's why it’s important to keep an eye on new approaches and evaluate whether they’re suitable for BMW. Or whether they could even replace existing solutions – perhaps by offering lower costs or enhanced features. Not every analysis or AI solution that performs well in a particular industry or use case can be directly applied to battery production.

Production of Gen6 high-voltage batteries is groundbreaking for the BMW Group. What, in your opinion, makes this project unique?

PZ: One unique aspect is the end-to-end responsibility – from data provision and data transfer to the cloud, all the way through to selective and even continuous analyses. We process both numerical data and visual representations from the equipment. Throughout the process, we maintain a consistent zero-defect approach to producing our high-voltage batteries. Highly intelligent, AI-supported quality checks are integrated into the production process to help us achieve this. We rely on OPC UA interface technology for plant connectivity. This enables us to model standardised digital twins directly at our plants, eliminating the need for additional data processing. Data is transferred to the BMW Group's clouds, using the same data structure across all production sites. This allows us to roll out standardised analysis dashboards worldwide and, for example, implement process optimisations more rapidly. We’ve already established this IT architecture at our high-voltage battery pilot plants. We have now been able to transfer our analysis dashboards to the first series production plants with minimal effort.

Entire new plants and assembly halls are being built for production of the new Gen6 high-voltage batteries. Is this beneficial for the IT structure?

PZ: Absolutely! Building several plants for Gen6 high-voltage batteries on greenfield sites gives us a whole new level of design freedom. This allows for much bigger leaps in IT, compared to integrating new solutions into existing plants – a so-called brownfield. I, for one, find it really exciting to help shape the Industrial Internet of Things and data analytics on such a large scale right from the start .

# BMW Group profitability in line with expectations in first quarter
## +++ Pre-tax earnings (EBT) exceed €3.1 billion; Group EBT margin at 9.2% +++ Automotive Segment’s 6.9% EBIT margin at upper end of full-year guidance +++ BEVs remain strongest growth driver: +32.4% +++ Over a quarter of all vehicles delivered in Q1 were electrified +++ Outlook for 2025 confirmed based on updated premises +++ Zipse: “Technology-open approach remains a key success factor” +++
Date: 2025-05-07 | Author: Britta Ullrich BMW Group | ID: T0450023EN_US
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Munich. Attractive products, strong order volumes and strict cost discipline have ensured for the BMW Group a start to the year according to plan. The premium manufacturer from Munich continued its dynamic BEV ramp-up in a volatile and competitive environment, while delivering profitability at the upper end of its 2025 target range in the Automotive Segment. The BMW Group has thus once again confirmed the long-term viability of its strategy of technology openness.

In the first quarter of the year, the BMW Group delivered 586,117 premium vehicles to customers (-1.4%). More than a quarter of these were electrified ( 26.9% ), with fully-electric vehicles once again showing significant sales growth of +32.4% . The EBIT margin in the Automotive Segment – one of the company’s key profit indicators – stood at 6.9% , placing it at the upper end of the targeted range of 5-7% for the year.

“The more challenging the environment, the more crucial it is to have compelling products, a consistent strategy and a high degree of flexibility. Our technology-open approach remains a key success factor: with our young, highly attractive models and our broad range of drives, we are able to meet the various needs of customers worldwide. This enables us to achieve robust results and stay on course to meet our ambitious full-year targets,” said [EXECUTIVE_OFFICER], Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG . “With the NEUE KLASSE, we are putting our biggest future project on the road: we are expanding our fully-electric offering, and rolling out future technology clusters and the new design language across our entire model portfolio. This will raise the level of innovation in our vehicles across all drive types to a whole new level – while also setting the course for profitable growth and sustainable success.”

Significant increase in fully-electric vehicle deliveries

Despite persistently strong competition in China, the company's global deliveries remained largely in line with the previous year (-1.4%). In the first three months, the BMW Group achieved growth in key markets Europe (+6.2%) and the US (+4.0%).

In the first quarter of 2025, the BMW brand delivered a total of 520,121 vehicles to customers worldwide, surpassing the previous year’s volume in all regions except China. The strongest growth was recorded by the new BMW 5 Series models (+35.8%), as well as the BMW X1 and X2 variants (+31.8%).

The BMW M brand achieved solid sales growth of +5.0% in the first quarter, delivering a total of 50,500 vehicles to customers. The main growth drivers were the high-performance models BMW M3* and M3 Touring* as well as BMW M5* and BMW M5 touring*, which were in high demand across all regions.

The MINI brand, which updated its entire product range over the course of last year, sold 64,615 units worldwide – an increase of 4.1%. The Rolls-Royce brand delivered 1,381 units to customers between January and March (-9.4%).

Fully-electric vehicles from the BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce brands reported significant growth, with 109,513 deliveries worldwide (+32.4%). The BMW iX1* was the brand’s most successful BEV model, while the BMW i4* accounted for half of all BMW 4 Series delivered.

Sales of fully-electric vehicles saw the strongest growth in Europe (+64.2%). New models from the MINI brand were major contributors to this: The urban premium brand delivered a total of 22,794 fully-electric vehicles, achieving a BEV share of 35.3% .

The BMW Group currently offers at least one model with an electrified drive train in every vehicle class. Total deliveries of electrified vehicles ( BEVs and PHEVs ) also rose significantly in the first three months of the year, reaching 157,487 vehicles (2024: 122,582 vehicles/+28.5%).

The BMW Group is successfully implementing its strategic plan to further expand e-mobility. Additionally, it will reach two significant sales milestones: first, the delivery of 1.5 million fully-electric premium vehicles since the market launch of the BMW i3 in 2013; and second, a total of three million electrified cars since then.

Group EBT margin at 9.2%

First-quarter Group revenues totalled € 33,758 million (2024: € 36,614 million/-7.8%; currency-adjusted: -8,7%). As previously announced, the BMW Group benefited from a moderate reduction in administrative and sales expenses. Compared with the previous year, sales revenues declined particularly in the highly competitive Chinese market, as expected.

Between January and March, the BMW Group reported pre-tax earnings (EBT) of € 3,113 million (2024: € 4,162 million/-25.2%).

The EBT margin for this period was 9.2% (2024: 11.4%). Group net profit for the first quarter totalled € 2,173 million (2024: € 2,951 million/-26.4%).

Automotive EBIT margin at upper end of full-year guidance

The Automotive Segment earned revenues of € 29,211 million (2024: € 30,939 million/-5.6%%).

The anti-subsidy tariffs on BEVs produced in China , introduced by the European Commission in October, increased the cost of sales, creating a headwind in the low three-digit million euro range, as forecast.

Earnings before financial result (EBIT) for the first quarter totalled € 2,024 million (2024: € 2,710 million/-25.3%). The EBIT margin came in at 6.9% (2024: 8.8%) and was thus at the high end of the target range of 5-7% for the year. Excluding depreciation and amortisation from the BBA purchase price allocation ,the EBIT margin for the first quarter was 8.1% .

The BMW Group is systematically leveraging innovations, focusing on efficient and low-emission technologies, as well as further electrification and digitalisation of both its product line-up and the company.

Based on the strength of its current operating performance, the BMW Group allocated € 1,984 million (2024: € 1,974 million/+0.5%) to research and development in the first quarter which was concentrated on electrification and digitalisation of the vehicle fleet across all model series.

The company also incurred R&D expenditure primarily for the future models of the NEUE KLASSE, such as the BMW iX3, and the successor models to the BMW X5 and BMW X7.

“The BMW Group stands for long-term growth, sustainable value creation and continued dependability for its stakeholders. Stable financial performance and effective cost management characterised the first quarter despite the challenging environment. We remain focused on improving our efficiency and optimising our cost structures,” said Walter Mertl, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Finance, at the quarterly conference call in Munich.

“Digitalisation and AI are contributing to this. Innovation and business benefits go hand in hand for us. We are also leveraging the proven flexibility of our network to address the current geopolitical challenges.”

Automotive Segment free cash flow at € 413 million

The free cash flow of the Automotive segment amounted to €413 million in the first quarter of 2025 (2024: €1,283 million). The decline compared to the previous year is primarily due to lower earnings before taxes, an expected higher consumption of provisions, and increased cash outflows from capital expenditures related to 31 December 2024 in the amount of €964 million.

Conversely, the seasonally typical but significantly lower increase in stock compared to the previous year led to the change in working capital of €65 million (2024: -€1,189 million).

From January to March, capital expenditure totaled €1,202 million (2024: €1,323 million/-9.1%). The capex ratio came in at 3.6% (2024: 3.6%).

The BMW Group is still targeting a free cash flow of > € 5 billion in the Automotive Segment for the full year.

Robust performance in Financial Services Segment

BMW Group Financial Services benefited from dynamic new leasing business in the first quarter of the year, with new leasing contracts up 12.7%. Overall, total new retail business was down slightly, compared to the previous year, with 402,811 new contracts concluded (-4.6%). The financing and leasing business for new vehicles remained at the previous year's level. Outside of China, new business was stable at a high level.

The volume of new business increased slightly, driven by higher financing volumes per vehicle across all financing and leasing contracts with retail customers, reaching € 15,988 million (2024: € 15,620 million/+2.4%).

The percentage of BMW Group new vehicles leased or financed by the Financial Services Segment reached 43.0% at the end of the first quarter (2024: 41.8%/+1.2 percentage points). In the three-month period, the segment reported pre-tax earnings of € 650 million (2024: € 730 million/-11.0%). Most notably, lower income from the resale of end-of-lease vehicles led to a year-on-year decrease in earnings, as the number of end-of-lease vehicles was lower than in the previous year. During the reporting period, the credit loss ratio remained at the low rate of 0.23% across the entire loan portfolio (2024: 0.21%).

BMW Motorrad with EBT margin of 9.4%

In the year to the end of March, BMW Motorrad delivered 44,609 motorcycles and scooters to customers (2024: 46,434 units; -3.9%). The segment EBIT margin of 9.4% (2024: 12.2%) was above the targeted range of 5.5-7.5% for the year.

BMW AG continues share repurchase programme

Following the authorisation granted by the Annual General Meeting of BMW AG on 11 May 2022, the company has acquired treasury shares. The shares from the initial repurchase programme have already been retired.

As of 31 March 2025, BMW AG holds 22,317,345 own shares from the second buy-back programme, corresponding to a nominal amount of €22,317,345.

Based on the authorisation granted at the Annual General Meeting of 11 May 2022, as of 31 March 2025, BMW AG had purchased shares equivalent to 7.27% of the share capital.

BMW Group confirms full-year guidance The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has revised its forecasts for global economic growth downwards to 2.8% in April 2025: Current trade conflicts and the associated potential rise in inflation, as well as uncertainty among businesses and consumers, could weigh on global growth.

According to sector forecasts, the global automotive markets are likely to see slight growth.

The BMW Group expects demand to rise in many markets in 2025, driven by a stabilizing inflation and further moderate interest rate cuts. In the USA, permanent tariffs could be reflected in rising inflation.

The guidance* published in the BMW Group Report 2024 in March 2025 includes all tariff increases that had taken effect by 12 March 2025. Due to the volatile developments and ongoing negotiations, the potential impact of tariffs in the current financial year can only be estimated, based on assumptions. The BMW Group expects some of the tariff increases to be temporary, with reductions from July 2025. The forecast also includes mitigating measures to offset the impact of higher tariffs.

Given the sustained demand for its attractive premium vehicles, the BMW Group is able to confirm its guidance for the year. The company anticipates slight sales growth, with fully-electric vehicles contributing to a slightly higher share of deliveries. Due to the factors mentioned above, Group earnings before tax are expected to be on a par with the previous year .**The EBIT margin for the Automotive Segment is forecast to be within the range of 5.0-7.0%, with an RoCE of between 9-13%.

In the Financial Services Segment, RoE is projected to be between 13-16%.

In the Motorcycles Segment , a slight increase in sales and an EBIT margin within the range of 5.5-7.5%are forecast, with an RoCE of 13-17%.

The above targets will be achieved with the current number of employees .

The BMW Group’s actual business performance may deviate from these projections – for example, due to changes in political and macroeconomic conditions. Risks to earnings could arise, for instance, from further tariff increases or tariffs remaining in place for longer than planned, potentially extending well into the second half of the year. The company continues to closely monitor macroeconomic developments.

Escalation of trade disputes could also lead to supply bottlenecks – for example, from import or export restrictions on specific parts or raw materials.

GLOSSARY – explanatory comments on key performance indicators

Battery Electric Vehicle. Deliveries to customers

A new or used vehicle is recorded as a delivery once it is handed over to the end user (which also includes leaseholders under lease contracts with BMW Financial Services). In the US and Canada, end users also include (1) dealers when they designate a vehicle as a service loaner or demonstrator vehicle and (2) dealers and other third parties when they purchase a company vehicle at auction and dealers when they purchase company vehicles directly from the BMW Group. Deliveries may be made by BMW AG, one of its international subsidiaries, a BMW Group retail outlet, or independent third-party dealers. The vast majority of deliveries – and hence the reporting of deliveries to the BMW Group – is made by independent third-party dealers. Retail vehicle deliveries during a given reporting period do not correlate directly to the revenues that the BMW Group recognises in respect of that particular reporting period.

Profit before financial result. Profit before financial result comprises revenues less cost of sales, less selling and administrative expenses and plus/minus net other operating income and expenses.

EBIT margin

Profit/loss before financial result as a percentage of revenues.

EBIT plus financial result.

Profit/loss as a percentage of revenues.

Plug-in-hybrid electric vehicle.

Return on capital employed (RoCE). RoCE in the Automotive and Motorcycles segments is measured on the basis of relevant segment profit before financial result and the average amount of capital employed – at the end of the last five quarters – in the segment concerned. Capital employed corresponds to the sum of all current and non-current operational assets, less liabilities that generally do not incur interest.

Return on equity (RoE). RoE in the Financial Services segment is calculated as segment profit before taxes, divided by the average amount of equity capital – at the end of the last five quarters – attributable to the Financial Services segment.

# The BMW M4 CS Edition VR46: Exclusive edition marks BMW M works driver Valentino Rossi’s birthday
## • Two characteristic design variants: Sport and Style • Each limited to 46 cars • Visit to the VR46 Motor Ranch and Misano racetrack forms exclusive highlight
Date: 2025-02-25 | Author: Christian Pomp BMW Group | ID: T0448260EN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The #46 is now 46 – and BMW M has the perfect present to mark the birthday of nine-time motorcycle world champion and current BMW M works driver Valentino Rossi (ITA): the BMW M4 CS Edition VR46. This exclusive edition, produced at BMW Group Plant Dingolfing, is available in two distinctive design variants: Sport and Style. “The Doctor” himself was personally involved in the design process for the two versions, both of which will be built in a limited run of 46 cars. The world-famous number, which is Rossi’s trademark, features prominently in several places on and inside the BMW M4 CS Edition VR46 – for example, on the doors and the roof, which is made of carbon-fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP).

Purchasing a BMW M4 CS Edition VR46 also comes with a once-in-a-lifetime experience comprising an exclusive, personal meeting with Valentino Rossi at his home – the VR46 Motor Ranch in Tavullia (ITA) – and a BMW M Driving Experience at the Misano race circuit (ITA).

"There is no other brand that has motorsport so deeply rooted in its DNA as BMW M. I am proud to be a BMW M works driver, and to share this passion. The fact that there is now a special VR46 edition, in which I was involved from the very beginning of the design process, makes me proud. When I see the BMW M4 CS Edition VR46 out on the road or on the race track later, it will be very cool,” says Valentino Rossi about the edition and the collaboration with BMW M.

Exclusive BMW Individual paint finishes and special exterior and interior details

One way in which the BMW M4 CS Edition VR46 differs from the BMW M4 CS is its two exclusive BMW Individual paint finishes, which blend perfectly with the many exposed carbon surfaces, such as the indents in the bonnet. Other distinctive features include a host of exclusive exterior and interior details. The overall colour concept of the two design versions is inspired by Valentino Rossi’s preferred tones and expressive visual style.

For example, the “Sport” has a finish in Marina Bay Blue metallic, while both sides of the car display an outsized “46” in the darker Tanzanite Blue metallic. In the “Style” design variant, the bodywork comes in matt Frozen Tanzanite Blue metallic, with the “46” this time in Frozen Marina Bay Blue metallic on both sides. In a nod to Rossi's favoured colour scheme, the BMW M kidney grille outline and one of the V spokes in the forged M light-alloy wheels – which, as on racing cars, indicates the position of the tyre valve – are painted in bright yellow, as are the brake callipers with M logo and an accent strip over the door frames of the “Sport” variant. The carbon-fibre roof – like the sides of the car, painted by hand – is adorned with a large VR46 logo (also in yellow, of course) and Rossi’s signature. The tailgate features VR46 lettering.

The yellow accents continue in the interior of the BMW M4 CS Edition VR46, which is predominantly Night Blue. The M Carbon bucket seats come with Merino leather upholstery in the Black/Night Blue colour combination. The Sao Paulo Yellow of the Alcantara shoulder area creates an exclusive contrast. The head restraints, like the door sill trims, feature a prominent yellow VR46 logo. Furthermore, the M Alcantara steering wheel with three-spoke design and flat-bottomed rim comes with yellow contrast stitching and a yellow centre marker. On the carbon-fibre centre console of all examples of the Edition VR46 is a badge stating “1/46”, identifying each Sport or Style car as one of the limited run.

Six-cylinder in-line engine with 405 kW/550 hp

The beating heart of the BMW M4 CS Edition VR46 is a high-revving 3.0-litre, six‑cylinder in-line engine with M TwinPower Turbo technology. This power unit has had track performance as its raison d’être from day one of its development. The increase in the maximum charge pressure of the two mono-scroll turbochargers to 2.1 bar and model-specific tweaks to the engine management mean the edition model’s engine now generates 405 kW/550 hp, which is relayed to the road via an eight-speed M Steptronic transmission, the M xDrive intelligent all-wheel-drive system and the Active M Differential. Lightning-fast power development and optimised traction enable the car to accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h in 3.4 seconds, and from 0 to 200 km/h in 11.1 seconds. When applying the “1-foot rollout” method**, the figures read 3.1 seconds for the sprint from 0 to 100 km/h and 10.8 seconds for 0 to 200 km/h. Acceleration from 80 to 120 km/h takes 2.6 seconds in fourth gear and 3.3 seconds in fifth. The top speed of the edition model, which comes with the M Driver’s Package as standard, is electronically limited to 302 km/h.

Contributing to the excellent engine response is a model-specific engine mounting with increased spring rates. The rigid connection between the power unit and the vehicle’s structure enables particularly direct transmission of its power to the drivetrain every time the driver presses the accelerator. The oil supply system – like the cooling system – is designed to handle the specific challenges of track use, including consistently high revs and extreme lateral acceleration. The engine’s power delivery is accompanied by the emotionally stirring soundtrack generated by the dual-branch exhaust system, which features electrically controlled flaps, a titanium rear silencer with weight-minimising design and – in customary M fashion – two pairs of tailpipes painted in matt black.

Model-specific tuning for chassis technology and control systems

The chassis technology for the new BMW M4 CS Edition VR46 has been tuned precisely to the performance characteristics of the engine, the overall vehicle concept and its weight distribution. The individually tuned axle kinematics and bespoke wheel camber settings, dampers, auxiliary springs and anti-roll bars serve to optimise steering precision, transmission of lateral control forces when cornering, spring and damping response, and wheel location. The electronically controlled dampers of the adaptive M suspension likewise come in a model-specific set-up, as do the electromechanical M Servotronic steering with variable ratio, and the integrated braking system.

46 – the trademark of an exceptional racer

The number 46 has accompanied Valentino Rossi throughout his extraordinary career as a motorcycle racer and racing driver, and has become even more of a trademark than his nickname “The Doctor” or “Il Dottore”. Having seen his father Graziano Rossi race motorcycles with number 46, Valentino also opted for 46 from the start of his career – and never even swapped it for number 1 when he became world champion, as would have been his right.

Valentino Rossi claimed his first world title in the 125cc class in 1997. Two years later, he added the title in the 250cc class. In 2000, he took the step up to what was the top Grand Prix category, the 500cc class, in which he was crowned world champion in 2001. The following year, this category was replaced by the MotoGP class, and Rossi remained the dominant force. By 2005 he had added a further four world titles, and numbers eight and nine were to follow in 2008 and 2009. With these nine world championships and no fewer than 115 Grand Prix victories to his name, he is one of the three most successful motorcycle racers in history and a global motor sport and style icon. VR46 has become a worldwide trademark – and Rossi’s home town of Tavullia has even reduced its speed limit from the usual 50 km/h to 46 km/h in his honour.

BMW M works driver since the start of 2023

When the curtain fell on his motorcycle career at the finale to the 2021 season, Valentino Rossi turned his attention solely to car racing, having already attended multiple tests in [ADDRESS] race cars and made guest appearances in rallies and endurance races. Since the start of the 2023 season, he has been a BMW M works driver, plying his trade at the wheel of a BMW M4 GT3 for BMW M Team WRT in series including the GT World Challenge Europe and the FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC) – which includes the 24 Hours of Le Mans (FRA). At the start of February 2025, he finished runner-up in a BMW M4 GT3 at the [ADDRESS] Hour (AUS), the opening round of this season’s Intercontinental GT Challenge (IGTC).

Exclusive meeting with Valentino Rossi in Italy

An exclusive bonus that comes with purchasing a BMW M4 CS Edition VR46 is the opportunity to enjoy a very special two-day experience in Italy. Day one features a visit to the VR46 Motor Ranch in Tavullia, including a barbecue and a chance to talk shop with Valentino Rossi himself. On day two, you will head to the Misano World Circuit Marco Simoncelli for a special BMW M Driving Experience with the latest BMW M models. Rossi, at the wheel of a BMW M4 GT3, won GT World Challenge Europe Sprint Cup races at his home circuit in both 2023 and 2024.

New York/Munich. Just a few hours remain until an event that promises to deliver some of the most thrilling moments in golf, the first tee-off at the Ryder Cup, eagerly anticipated by golf and sports fans for the past two years. On the legendary Black Course at Bethpage State Park, the 45th edition of the iconic team duel between the best golfers from host nation USA and defending champions Europe will begin on Friday morning. BMW is accompanying the Ryder Cup for the third time as a Worldwide Partner, providing a large courtesy car fleet, unique experiences for customers and fans, and exclusively bringing the unparalleled emotions of the Ryder Cup live into BMW vehicles.

The opening ceremony on Wednesday evening offered a taste of the three days of competition ahead. Revered for its display of drama, camaraderie, and sportsmanship, the Ryder Cup delivers an electrifying fan experience that is unique across the golf world. A total of 28 matches will be played – four Foursomes and four Fourballs on both Friday and Saturday, twelve singles matches on Sunday. Team Europe, led by captain Luke Donald (ENG), needs only a tie (14 points) to retain the trophy. Keegan Bradley’s U.S. team requires at least 14.5 points but has the home advantage on its side. The last away victory was achieved in 2012 when Europe produced the ‘Miracle of Medinah’ in Chicago.

A fleet of more than 200 BMWs will provide premium shuttle service for players, guests, and event officials throughout the week. Like BMW customers in many countries*, they all enjoy the exclusive opportunity to follow the Ryder Cup live in their vehicles. In the U.S., the stream is provided by NBC, while in other markets, the World Feed is available. Customers can access the service via the video app (DTS AutoStage Video Service Powered by TiVo™) in the infotainment systems of their BMW vehicles. This feature is available in vehicles equipped with BMW Operating [ADDRESS].5 in combination with Connected Drive Professional* (not available in the BMW 2 Series Coupé, BMW 3 Series, and BMW 4 Series) as well as in vehicles with BMW Operating [ADDRESS] in combination with BMW Digital Premium*.

BMW is also offering its customers and guests an exclusive golfing experience at the event itself. The BMW House, with its large grandstand directly at the 14th tee, provides a fascinating opportunity to see the players and captains up close, as well as the new all-electric BMW iX3. This first model of the Neue Klasse made its world premiere just a few weeks ago in Munich and is now on display at Bethpage Black on the BMW grandstand. The Neue Klasse is far more than a new BMW model. It represents the redefinition of the BMW and heralds the start of a new era of Sheer Driving Pleasure. The new BMW iX3 showcases for the first time the major technological the leap forward in many areas: electromobility, display and operating concept, digitalisation, networking, design, and sustainability. All future BMW models will benefit from the innovations in the Neue Klasse – regardless of their drive technology.

Fans of golf and the Ultimate Driving Machine will also get a firsthand look at BMW innovation and design through interactive brand displays across Bethpage Black including dueling BMW 7 Series models custom ordered by American captain Keegan Bradley and European captain Luke Donald. In between the action on the fairways and greens, guests will be encouraged to showcase their own skills by joining BMW for a unique driving range challenge near the main entrance. Winners will walk away with BMW ball markers, same-day hospitality upgrades, and even an all-expenses-paid golf getaway to Sea Island Resort in Georgia if they’re able to hit the 150-yard target.

Another Ryder Cup hotspot can be found in the heart of Manhattan at the world-famous Rockefeller Center. The ‘Ryder Cup Live Fan Zone’ is the place for public viewing, golf challenges, food, drinks, and communal celebrations. BMW invites visitors to the BMW Viewing Lounge there to follow the thrilling action at Bethpage Black.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Munich. Attractive products, strong order volumes and strict cost discipline have ensured for the BMW Group a start to the year according to plan. The premium manufacturer from Munich continued its dynamic BEV ramp-up in a volatile and competitive environment, while delivering profitability at the upper end of its 2025 target range in the Automotive Segment. The BMW Group has thus once again confirmed the long-term viability of its strategy of technology openness.

In the first quarter of the year, the BMW Group delivered 586,117 premium vehicles to customers (-1.4%). More than a quarter of these were electrified ( 26.9% ), with fully-electric vehicles once again showing significant sales growth of +32.4% . The EBIT margin in the Automotive Segment – one of the company’s key profit indicators – stood at 6.9% , placing it at the upper end of the targeted range of 5-7% for the year.

“The more challenging the environment, the more crucial it is to have compelling products, a consistent strategy and a high degree of flexibility. Our technology-open approach remains a key success factor: with our young, highly attractive models and our broad range of drives, we are able to meet the various needs of customers worldwide. This enables us to achieve robust results and stay on course to meet our ambitious full-year targets,” said [EXECUTIVE_OFFICER], Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG . “With the NEUE KLASSE, we are putting our biggest future project on the road: we are expanding our fully-electric offering, and rolling out future technology clusters and the new design language across our entire model portfolio. This will raise the level of innovation in our vehicles across all drive types to a whole new level – while also setting the course for profitable growth and sustainable success.”

Significant increase in fully-electric vehicle deliveries

Despite persistently strong competition in China, the company's global deliveries remained largely in line with the previous year (-1.4%). In the first three months, the BMW Group achieved growth in key markets Europe (+6.2%) and the US (+4.0%).

In the first quarter of 2025, the BMW brand delivered a total of 520,121 vehicles to customers worldwide, surpassing the previous year’s volume in all regions except China. The strongest growth was recorded by the new BMW 5 Series models (+35.8%), as well as the BMW X1 and X2 variants (+31.8%).

The BMW M brand achieved solid sales growth of +5.0% in the first quarter, delivering a total of 50,500 vehicles to customers. The main growth drivers were the high-performance models BMW M3* and M3 Touring* as well as BMW M5* and BMW M5 touring*, which were in high demand across all regions.

The MINI brand, which updated its entire product range over the course of last year, sold 64,615 units worldwide – an increase of 4.1%. The Rolls-Royce brand delivered 1,381 units to customers between January and March (-9.4%).

Fully-electric vehicles from the BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce brands reported significant growth, with 109,513 deliveries worldwide (+32.4%). The BMW iX1* was the brand’s most successful BEV model, while the BMW i4* accounted for half of all BMW 4 Series delivered.

Sales of fully-electric vehicles saw the strongest growth in Europe (+64.2%). New models from the MINI brand were major contributors to this: The urban premium brand delivered a total of 22,794 fully-electric vehicles, achieving a BEV share of 35.3% .

The BMW Group currently offers at least one model with an electrified drive train in every vehicle class. Total deliveries of electrified vehicles ( BEVs and PHEVs ) also rose significantly in the first three months of the year, reaching 157,487 vehicles (2024: 122,582 vehicles/+28.5%).

The BMW Group is successfully implementing its strategic plan to further expand e-mobility. Additionally, it will reach two significant sales milestones: first, the delivery of 1.5 million fully-electric premium vehicles since the market launch of the BMW i3 in 2013; and second, a total of three million electrified cars since then.

Group EBT margin at 9.2%

First-quarter Group revenues totalled € 33,758 million (2024: € 36,614 million/-7.8%; currency-adjusted: -8,7%). As previously announced, the BMW Group benefited from a moderate reduction in administrative and sales expenses. Compared with the previous year, sales revenues declined particularly in the highly competitive Chinese market, as expected.

Between January and March, the BMW Group reported pre-tax earnings (EBT) of € 3,113 million (2024: € 4,162 million/-25.2%).

The EBT margin for this period was 9.2% (2024: 11.4%). Group net profit for the first quarter totalled € 2,173 million (2024: € 2,951 million/-26.4%).

Automotive EBIT margin at upper end of full-year guidance

The Automotive Segment earned revenues of € 29,211 million (2024: € 30,939 million/-5.6%%).

The anti-subsidy tariffs on BEVs produced in China , introduced by the European Commission in October, increased the cost of sales, creating a headwind in the low three-digit million euro range, as forecast.

Earnings before financial result (EBIT) for the first quarter totalled € 2,024 million (2024: € 2,710 million/-25.3%). The EBIT margin came in at 6.9% (2024: 8.8%) and was thus at the high end of the target range of 5-7% for the year. Excluding depreciation and amortisation from the BBA purchase price allocation ,the EBIT margin for the first quarter was 8.1% .

The BMW Group is systematically leveraging innovations, focusing on efficient and low-emission technologies, as well as further electrification and digitalisation of both its product line-up and the company.

Based on the strength of its current operating performance, the BMW Group allocated € 1,984 million (2024: € 1,974 million/+0.5%) to research and development in the first quarter which was concentrated on electrification and digitalisation of the vehicle fleet across all model series.

The company also incurred R&D expenditure primarily for the future models of the NEUE KLASSE, such as the BMW iX3, and the successor models to the BMW X5 and BMW X7.

“The BMW Group stands for long-term growth, sustainable value creation and continued dependability for its stakeholders. Stable financial performance and effective cost management characterised the first quarter despite the challenging environment. We remain focused on improving our efficiency and optimising our cost structures,” said Walter Mertl, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Finance, at the quarterly conference call in Munich.

“Digitalisation and AI are contributing to this. Innovation and business benefits go hand in hand for us. We are also leveraging the proven flexibility of our network to address the current geopolitical challenges.”

Automotive Segment free cash flow at € 413 million

The free cash flow of the Automotive segment amounted to €413 million in the first quarter of 2025 (2024: €1,283 million). The decline compared to the previous year is primarily due to lower earnings before taxes, an expected higher consumption of provisions, and increased cash outflows from capital expenditures related to 31 December 2024 in the amount of €964 million.

Conversely, the seasonally typical but significantly lower increase in stock compared to the previous year led to the change in working capital of €65 million (2024: -€1,189 million).

From January to March, capital expenditure totaled €1,202 million (2024: €1,323 million/-9.1%). The capex ratio came in at 3.6% (2024: 3.6%).

The BMW Group is still targeting a free cash flow of > € 5 billion in the Automotive Segment for the full year.

Robust performance in Financial Services Segment

BMW Group Financial Services benefited from dynamic new leasing business in the first quarter of the year, with new leasing contracts up 12.7%. Overall, total new retail business was down slightly, compared to the previous year, with 402,811 new contracts concluded (-4.6%). The financing and leasing business for new vehicles remained at the previous year's level. Outside of China, new business was stable at a high level.

The volume of new business increased slightly, driven by higher financing volumes per vehicle across all financing and leasing contracts with retail customers, reaching € 15,988 million (2024: € 15,620 million/+2.4%).

The percentage of BMW Group new vehicles leased or financed by the Financial Services Segment reached 43.0% at the end of the first quarter (2024: 41.8%/+1.2 percentage points). In the three-month period, the segment reported pre-tax earnings of € 650 million (2024: € 730 million/-11.0%). Most notably, lower income from the resale of end-of-lease vehicles led to a year-on-year decrease in earnings, as the number of end-of-lease vehicles was lower than in the previous year. During the reporting period, the credit loss ratio remained at the low rate of 0.23% across the entire loan portfolio (2024: 0.21%).

BMW Motorrad with EBT margin of 9.4%

In the year to the end of March, BMW Motorrad delivered 44,609 motorcycles and scooters to customers (2024: 46,434 units; -3.9%). The segment EBIT margin of 9.4% (2024: 12.2%) was above the targeted range of 5.5-7.5% for the year.

BMW AG continues share repurchase programme

Following the authorisation granted by the Annual General Meeting of BMW AG on 11 May 2022, the company has acquired treasury shares. The shares from the initial repurchase programme have already been retired.

As of 31 March 2025, BMW AG holds 22,317,345 own shares from the second buy-back programme, corresponding to a nominal amount of €22,317,345.

Based on the authorisation granted at the Annual General Meeting of 11 May 2022, as of 31 March 2025, BMW AG had purchased shares equivalent to 7.27% of the share capital.

BMW Group confirms full-year guidance The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has revised its forecasts for global economic growth downwards to 2.8% in April 2025: Current trade conflicts and the associated potential rise in inflation, as well as uncertainty among businesses and consumers, could weigh on global growth.

According to sector forecasts, the global automotive markets are likely to see slight growth.

The BMW Group expects demand to rise in many markets in 2025, driven by a stabilizing inflation and further moderate interest rate cuts. In the USA, permanent tariffs could be reflected in rising inflation.

The guidance* published in the BMW Group Report 2024 in March 2025 includes all tariff increases that had taken effect by 12 March 2025. Due to the volatile developments and ongoing negotiations, the potential impact of tariffs in the current financial year can only be estimated, based on assumptions. The BMW Group expects some of the tariff increases to be temporary, with reductions from July 2025. The forecast also includes mitigating measures to offset the impact of higher tariffs.

Given the sustained demand for its attractive premium vehicles, the BMW Group is able to confirm its guidance for the year. The company anticipates slight sales growth, with fully-electric vehicles contributing to a slightly higher share of deliveries. Due to the factors mentioned above, Group earnings before tax are expected to be on a par with the previous year .**The EBIT margin for the Automotive Segment is forecast to be within the range of 5.0-7.0%, with an RoCE of between 9-13%.

In the Financial Services Segment, RoE is projected to be between 13-16%.

In the Motorcycles Segment , a slight increase in sales and an EBIT margin within the range of 5.5-7.5%are forecast, with an RoCE of 13-17%.

The above targets will be achieved with the current number of employees .

The BMW Group’s actual business performance may deviate from these projections – for example, due to changes in political and macroeconomic conditions. Risks to earnings could arise, for instance, from further tariff increases or tariffs remaining in place for longer than planned, potentially extending well into the second half of the year. The company continues to closely monitor macroeconomic developments.

Escalation of trade disputes could also lead to supply bottlenecks – for example, from import or export restrictions on specific parts or raw materials.

Deliveries to customers

A new or used vehicle is recorded as a delivery once it is handed over to the end user (which also includes leaseholders under lease contracts with BMW Financial Services). In the US and Canada, end users also include (1) dealers when they designate a vehicle as a service loaner or demonstrator vehicle and (2) dealers and other third parties when they purchase a company vehicle at auction and dealers when they purchase company vehicles directly from the BMW Group. Deliveries may be made by BMW AG, one of its international subsidiaries, a BMW Group retail outlet, or independent third-party dealers. The vast majority of deliveries – and hence the reporting of deliveries to the BMW Group – is made by independent third-party dealers. Retail vehicle deliveries during a given reporting period do not correlate directly to the revenues that the BMW Group recognises in respect of that particular reporting period.

Profit before financial result. Profit before financial result comprises revenues less cost of sales, less selling and administrative expenses and plus/minus net other operating income and expenses.

EBIT margin

Profit/loss before financial result as a percentage of revenues.

EBIT plus financial result.

Profit/loss as a percentage of revenues.

Plug-in-hybrid electric vehicle.

Return on capital employed (RoCE). RoCE in the Automotive and Motorcycles segments is measured on the basis of relevant segment profit before financial result and the average amount of capital employed – at the end of the last five quarters – in the segment concerned. Capital employed corresponds to the sum of all current and non-current operational assets, less liabilities that generally do not incur interest.

Return on equity (RoE). RoE in the Financial Services segment is calculated as segment profit before taxes, divided by the average amount of equity capital – at the end of the last five quarters – attributable to the Financial Services segment.

# Four Superbrains for the Neue Klasse: More intelligent, more efficient, more powerful.
## +++ BMW takes the next step for the Software-Defined Vehicle (SDV) +++ Concentration of computing power for key customer functions in four "Superbrains" +++ Zonal wiring harness architecture 30% lighter and with 600 meters less wiring +++ Technology scales across all drivetrain variants +++ Future-oriented and flexible software architecture from the chip in the vehicle to the cloud +++
Date: 2025-03-11 | Author: Martin Tholund BMW Group | ID: T0448724EN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Munich. The BMW Group is the first automotive manufacturer to launch a completely newly developed digital nervous system for all drivetrain variants and vehicle segments. It is more intelligent, more powerful and more efficient and will be rolled out for the first time in the models of the Neue Klasse. Four high-performance computers , also called " Superbrains ", consolidate the computing power for the most important customer functions: infotainment, automated driving, driving dynamics, and basic functions such as vehicle access, climate control, and comfort. The four Superbrains provide more than 20 times the computing power compared to the current vehicle generation and are already designed for upcoming software and function updates, including AI-powered customer experiences.

"Technology openness is the key to BMW's success. Starting with the first model of the Neue Klasse, we will roll out the technologies of the Neue Klasse across the entire future model portfolio – across all segments and all drivetrains. This also applies to our completely newly developed electronic architecture made up of powerful 'Superbrains' and highly interconnected software platforms. This architecture allows us to decouple the development of the vehicle and software from each other. The advantage: More than ever before, all future BMW models will remain digitally up to date via over-the-air upgrades and will receive updates even from the next and subsequent vehicle generations," says Frank Weber, Board Member for Development at BMW AG.

A fundamental component of the digital nervous system is the radically simplified wiring harness. It is based on a so-called zonal wiring harness architecture , which uses 600 meters less wiring and brings 30% weight savings compared to the previous generation. The wiring harness is divided into four zones: front end, center, rear and roof. The Superbrains are connected via high-speed data connections to smaller control units, the zonal controllers, which manage and consolidate the data flow of the electronics in and out of the zones. The wiring in the vehicle is therefore zone-related and can thus be shorter, thinner, and lighter.

A crucial prerequisite for thinner and lighter wiring are the so-called "Smart eFuses". These are digital fuses that replace up to 150 traditional fuses. Smart eFuses can be intelligently programmed for digitally controlled energy distribution to components. The selective activation of components allows for the design of intelligent power modes for various vehicle states such as driving, parking, charging, and upgrading, in which unnecessary consumers can be identified and switched off. Thus, the eFuses make a significant contribution to the 20% improved energy efficiency .

The completely newly developed electronic architecture forms the basis for the next generation SDV. From the launch of the Neue Klasse, the upcoming BMW model generation will benefit from it. The first fully electric derivative of the Neue Klasse will go into series production later this year at the Debrecen plant (Hungary).

The advanced software architecture of the BMW Group builds on this new electronic architecture. With the multitude of digital functions in SDVs, it is crucial that functions can be continuously developed on stable software platforms rather than being newly developed for every new generation. This is precisely what is achieved with the Neue Klasse. In the vehicle the software platforms run on the respective Superbrains, and the vehicle functions run on top of them. The "Shared Service Layer" acts as a connecting element (middleware) and provides, among other things, state-of-the-art cybersecurity and flexible over-the-air updates. It also enables customer-relevant AI functions thanks to intelligent networking of cross-domain data sources.

"With the introduction of the Neue Klasse, we are entering a mode of software development where we achieve software continuity. This means we continuously develop software rather than starting from scratch each time," says Christoph Grote, Senior Vice President BMW Group Electronics and Software . "Based on our advanced software architecture and the fact that today our global development teams generate 130 times more software than ten years ago, we see ourselves in an excellent competitive position. More than ever, our software developers can focus on product innovations."

For the Neue Klasse, the development teams are working on well over 1,000 software modules, over 20 GB of software, and over 500 million lines of code, which will ultimately be integrated into the Superbrains and the rest of the electronic architecture in the vehicle. To achieve this, the BMW Group has established a solid foundation for future-proof and highly effective vehicle software development in recent years. Innovative methods and tools have been anchored in the continuously growing global developer network. At the heart of vehicle software development is the integrated developer environment: a tailored tool-chain called "CodeCraft." The speed and quality of development have been enhanced with the use of a variety of tools that support the software developer with generative AI. CodeCraft runs in the cloud on up to 75,000 virtual CPUs, supports the simultaneous work of well over 10,000 software developers, and records up to 200,000 software builds per day at peak times. This corresponds to a productivity increase of more than 130 times compared to ten years ago.

+++ Hideki Matsuyama (JPN, -12) leads world-class field after two rounds +++ European Ryder Cup trio trails by one shot +++ Images from the first two rounds of the BMW PGA Championship +++

London. The debut of Japan’s Hideki Matsuyama at the BMW PGA Championship has been nothing short of a success story so far. After two days, the 2021 Masters Champion, who delivered the tournament’s best round so far with a 64 on Friday, leads the world-class field with a total score of 12 under par. Hot on his heels are three players from the European Ryder Cup team: Ludvig Åberg (SWE), Viktor Hovland (NOR), and Justin Rose (ENG, all -11). One stroke further back is Spain’s Pablo Larrazábal, winner of the BMW International Open in 2011 and 2015, in fifth place. Other high-profile names, such as Major winners Matt Fitzpatrick (ENG) and Patrick Reed (USA, both -7), are within striking distance, promising a spectacular weekend ahead.

# My BMW App shows drivers CO2 emissions over the entire life cycle for the first time.
## +++ BMW Group expands the range of My Trips driving statistics for the My BMW App and MINI App +++ The driver’s carbon impact is based on their vehicle’s footprint and routes driven +++ Available for selected models with all types of drive system +++
Date: 2025-07-21 | Author: Wieland Brúch BMW Group | ID: T0451899EN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Munich. The BMW Group is now offering customers even broader scope for personalising analysis of their driving stats in the My BMW App and MINI App. The latest update allows drivers to view their personal carbon footprint for the first time.

“Our usage research shows: The information in My Trips is one of the most popular features in the app,” says Dirk Wiedmann, Senior Vice President Sales Steering and Strategy, Digitalization. “We are now expanding this successful function with carbon footprint calculation, giving our customers simple and straightforward access to sustainability-related information via a popular and widely used channel.”

Emissions from vehicle production and use: two sets of figures make up the driver’s personal footprint. The personal carbon footprint function has been designed with a technology-open approach and is available for vehicles with combustion engines, as well as plug-in hybrid and fully electric models. At launch, this feature will be rolled out across selected models in various European countries*. Calculation of the personal footprint is based on two central sets of figures.

Ready for electric mobility: My BMW App helps with the transition.

The My BMW App also includes the Electric Vehicle Analysis introduced last summer. This function allows customers whose BMW is powered by a combustion engine to simulate how well a fully electric BMW fits their personal driving profile. Here, the customer selects an electric BMW model as an alternative vehicle in the app. Once the combustion-engined model has made at least 200 journeys and covered a distance of 2,000 kilometres (over 1,240 miles), the analysis shows the journeys the user could have completed on a single charge with the electric vehicle selected, and also flags up charging stations close to frequently visited destinations. More than 100,000 customers had used this analysis by May 2025.

[ADDRESS] million customers around the world use the My BMW App and MINI App. The My Trips function is available in more than 90 countries and is actively used by 1.9 million users.

* The new function is available to users of vehicles for which a TÜV-certified carbon footprint has been calculated. The feature will launch in Germany, Austria, Belgium, France, Luxemburg and Switzerland, and be available in the BMW 1 Series (code 81GE), BMW 2 Series (31GH), BMW X2 (71GM, 21GM), BMW X3 (11GR, 31GP, 65GP), BMW 5 Series (31FK, 11JF, 71FJ), BMW 5 Series Touring (11HH, 11GW, 21GV), BMW M5 (81FK) and BMW iX (41CF) and MINI Cooper (11GC), MINI Cooper C (11GD), MINI Aceman (31GC) and MINI Countryman (41GA, 11GA).

+++ [ADDRESS],521 cars produced in 2024, Plant Regensburg was the BMW Group’s highest-volume vehicle plant in Europe +++ Plant Director Armin Ebner: “New body shop will help meet high market demand” – with over 120 vehicle bodies produced per workday +++ Preparations for next model generation +++

Regensburg. Today, BMW Group Plant Regensburg commissioned a new body shop at Plant [ADDRESS].12 (Neutraubling), attended by Regensburg’s local commissioner, Tanja Schweiger, and Neutraubling mayor, Harald Stadler. Plant Director Armin Ebner: “The BMW X1 and BMW X2 produced in Regensburg remain extremely popular with customers worldwide. In the new production hall in Neutraubling, we currently manufacture over 120 vehicle bodies per day, helping us meet high market demand.” Once completed, the bodies from Neutraubling are transported to the vehicle plant in Regensburg, where they are assembled into finished cars around the clock in three-shift operation.

Local Commissioner Tanja Schweiger: “In these increasingly challenging times, BMW continues to be a key player in the automotive industry. The decision to expand the body shop for these two best-selling models represents a clear strategy for the future and marks a significant positive development for the Regensburg district’s status as a location for industry.” Neutraubling Mayor Harald Stadler added: “The fact that you are expanding your plant here is a strong commitment to the location and shows that the economy feels at home with us. As mayor, I am also very proud when BMW vehicles with bodies 'made in Neutraubling' are on the roads all over the world.”

Regensburg: the BMW Group’s highest-volume European vehicle plant

[ADDRESS] seconds, a new vehicle rolls off the Regensburg assembly line – adding up to more than 1,400 vehicles per day. With an annual production of 342,521 cars, Plant Regensburg was the BMW Group’s highest-volume vehicle plant in Europe in 2024, exceeding its 2023 production (238,301 units) by more than 100,000 vehicles. Over a third of the vehicles manufactured in Regensburg in 2024 were electrified, either as plug-in hybrids or fully-electric models. “We build our vehicles for the global market and contribute to the growth of electromobility,” emphasised Ebner.

Body shop expanded to approx. 40,000 m² – with about 150 employees

An approx. 40,000-square-metre hall on Berliner Straße was remodelled to accommodate the new body shop in Neutraubling. To the north, four smaller extensions were built, covering nearly 1,000 square metres. [ADDRESS] employees currently work in the hall in a single shift. The production hall, which was built in 2003, is located on premises owned by the firm Preymesser. BMW previously rented this facility, using the space for logistics purposes. In April 2024, the company successfully applied for a change of use from the town of Neutraubling and the Regensburg County Administration Office. “I would like to say a big thank to the authorities for approving this request and for the excellent support from the town and County Administration Office,” underlined Ebner.

Implemented in record time of less than 12 months – thanks to “tremendous team effort”

The new body shop was constructed in a record time of less than 12 months. “What we have achieved here in recent months is not only impressive because of the speed. The cooperation with all internal and external partners has been outstanding,” said Ebner, praising the “tremendous team effort of everyone involved”. Dismantling of the previous logistics facilities and construction of the new body shop went hand in hand. The first test bodies rolled off the assembly line in January and production ramped up in early March. A total of 294 robots are in use. 238 welding guns set up to 4,771 welding points per vehicle body. As part of the capacity expansion, BMW X1 bodies will no longer be produced solely in the existing body shop in Regensburg, but also in Neutraubling.

Preparations for next model generation

With an investment of over 550 million euros in the past two years, the BMW Group has also secured the long-term future of both Upper Palatinate locations: Regensburg and Wackersdorf. Plant Director Armin Ebner: “This signals our firm commitment to Upper Palatinate as as location for industry.” At the same time as building current models, BMW Group Plant Regensburg is already preparing for production of the next model generation. “With the NEUE KLASSE, the company aims to set new standards for digitalisation, electrification and circularity – and we are gearing up for this in Regensburg as well,” said Ebner. During the production break over the New Year period, remodelling at the plant continued in the body shop, paint shop and vehicle assembly. Further, more extensive structural measures will follow during a five-week production downtime in summer 2025.

“FACTORY OF THE YEAR” award recognises outstanding performance

Numerous accolades for the plant and vehicle models built in Regensburg have confirmed the location's outstanding performance in recent years. Just a few days ago, the Plant Regensburg team was presented with the “FACTORY OF THE YEAR” 2024 award in the category “excellent large-series assembly” at a congress in Ludwigsburg. The award is regarded as one of Germany’s most prestigious industrial competitions. The judges noted that “the innovation and dynamism with which Plant Regensburg is implementing the transformation towards the iFACTORY, together with the entire workforce, is highly impressive. In particular, the flexibility in both the factory set-up and among its employees is exemplary and serves as inspiration for successful production in Germany.”

BMW Group Plants Regensburg and Wackersdorf

The BMW Group vehicle plant in Regensburg has been in operation since 1986 and is one of more than 30 BMW Group production locations worldwide. Every workday, around 1,400 vehicles of the BMW X1 and BMW X2 models roll off the production line at Plant Regensburg, destined for customers around the globe. Different types of drive trains are flexibly manufactured on a single production line – ranging from vehicles with internal combustion engines to plug-in hybrids and fully-electric models. BMW Group Plant Regensburg was recognised as “FACTORY OF THE YEAR” 2024 in the category “excellent large-series assembly” of the prestigious industrial competition. As it implements the so-called BMW iFACTORY, the BMW Group is focused on digitalisation of the Regensburg plant site to create a digital and intelligently connected factory. It is already possible to experience in virtual form what the factory will look like a few years from now. Production of models for the NEUE KLASSE, BMW’s next generation of vehicles, will ramp up in Regensburg in the second half of the decade. The BMW Group plant in Wackersdorf is home to cockpit production and parts supply for overseas plants. With the opening of a new battery testing centre and commissioning of the first phase in autumn 2024, the location is also a key facilitator for electromobility. An entirely new area of expertise is the door and flap centre for Rolls-Royce.

The BMW Group core staff at the Regensburg and Wackersdorf locations in eastern Bavaria consists of around 9,250 employees, including about 300 apprentices.

# New BMW Panoramic iDrive revolutionises vehicle operation. Visionary technology package for the Neue Klasse celebrates world premiere at CES 2025.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: This press release is a 1:1 copy of the original issued by BMW headquarters in Germany. No adaptions have been made to cater to the UK market.

Munich/Las Vegas. The BMW Group presents the driving and user experience of the future at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2025 in Las Vegas. BMW is providing the first opportunity to experience the close-to-production version of the new BMW iDrive – complete with its centrepiece, BMW Panoramic Vision – at the event. The software underpinning it all is the new BMW Operating System X, which acts as the intelligence hub behind the new display and operating concept. The holistic system, with its modern, style-shaping design, will be introduced in all new BMW models from the end of 2025. “High tech meets highly intuitive operation – a quarter of a century of pioneering work and technological leadership in operating concepts has been channelled into the new BMW Panoramic iDrive,” says Frank Weber, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, responsible for Development . “The foundations are provided by the new BMW Operating System X. With this advance, we are giving one of the world’s best and most comprehensive infotainment systems even greater capability and once again setting the industry benchmark in multimodal interaction. Starting with the first series-produced Neue Klasse model at the end of this year, the new BMW Panoramic iDrive will form an integral part of all future BMW models.”

Four elements, one goal: consistent driver focus in characteristic BMW style. The new BMW iDrive merges four central elements into a unique display and operating concept.

The combination of these four elements re-interprets BMW’s customary “hands on the wheel, eyes on the road” approach, with which BMW sets the benchmark for driver focus and presents a unique form of intuitive, use-friendly and ergonomically optimised operation. The BMW Panoramic iDrive always gives the driver the right information in the right place and at the right time. The system continues the approach of using an optimal combination of analogue and digital controls through the use of switches, buttons, touch and voice control. There are haptic switches for the windscreen wipers, turn signal indicators, exterior mirrors, volume control, gear selectors and window de-icers. Other functions are optimised for operation using touch/voice control or via the multifunction steering wheel, such as telephone functions, media control systems, navigation, assisted driving, personalisation of displays, selection of MyModes and much more besides.

Alongside data-driven learnings on the use of BMW Operating Systems across the global fleet of now more than 22 million connected BMW vehicles, the development phase of the new BMW Panoramic iDrive also included numerous studies conducted in the BMW Group’s usability labs, in which around 3,000 customers were involved. Every decision on the various aspects of the operating logic is therefore based on data and made in a structured manner. Here, the user experience’s extended scope for personalisation has also been aligned with customer preferences and requirements.

BMW Operating System X: intelligent, versatile, fit for the future. The new BMW Operating System X represents an update of the latest operating system, as used in many BMW models, and is a wholly in-house development from BMW. Like BMW Operating [ADDRESS], it is based on an Android Open Source Project (AOSP) software stack. It offers even greater update and upgrade capability than the predecessor system, making it both fit for the future and backwards compatible. It is ready to accommodate additional functions and will keep vehicles equipped with the new BMW Panoramic iDrive at the cutting edge of technology over a long period of time. “The overall concept of the new BMW Panoramic iDrive with Operating System X has been enabled by a large technological leap forward,” says Stephan Durach Senior Vice President Connected Company BMW Group . “It offers intuitive operation, emotionally engaging experiences and specific personalisation. The new BMW iDrive with Operating System X demonstrates the potential of a software-defined vehicle.”

The expanded intelligence of BMW Operating System X makes it possible to combine the BMW Panoramic Vision, optional BMW 3D Head-Up Display, central display and multifunction steering wheel with one another in such a way that physical and digital experiences merge. For example, an incoming call initially brings up a graphic on the BMW Panoramic Vision. At the same time, a symbol on the relevant steering wheel button that was not previously visible is illuminated in green, indicating the option of taking the call by pressing the button or rejecting it with a swipe on the right-hand side of the steering wheel. When a navigation destination is entered by touch control or voice command, route guidance alerts are shown on the BMW 3D Head-Up Display and further information on roads and junctions on the BMW Panoramic Vision. A whole map overview can be shown on the central display at any time for broader-scale orientation.

The personalisation of content reaches a new level with BMW Operating System X. The displays in the Panoramic Vision can be adapted to personal preferences. In addition, drivers now also have the option of choosing their own settings for driving attributes such as response and steering characteristics in the My Mode “Personal”. Moreover, pictures chosen by the user can be uploaded as backgrounds for the Central Display and the colourway of the Ambient Lighting and user interface design adjusted to their particular preferences, creating an even more personalised driving experience.

The BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant responds in the accustomed way to the prompt “Hey BMW” or can be called up by pressing the respective button on the multifunction steering wheel. The capabilities of the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant are being constantly enhanced and will be taken to a whole new level for the Neue Klasse through the integration of Large Language Models (LLM). The use of this technology is focused initially on navigation, allowing the customer to give more extensive spoken commands using natural language: for example: “Take me to a charging station which is close to a food store.” At technology partner Amazon’s booth at CES 2025, visitors can get an initial impression of these capabilities using a beta version of this build of the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant in a BMW X3.

As with the current infotainment systems from BMW, the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant can – if the driver desires – make suggestions proactively based on user behaviour. This intelligence expands further with BMW Operating System X. In relevant situations, the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant highlights driver assistance systems, which are rarely used by the driver. As a kind of reminder, the system suggests activating Sport Mode on suitable routes if the driver has already activated Sport Mode independently beforehand. If the driver doesn’t respond to or ignores these proactive suggestions several times, the system learns and refrains from making suggestions from then on.

BMW Operating System X carries over the scope for integration of third-party apps from the previous infotainment generation. As things stand, the BMW ConnectedDrive Store offers more than 60 apps worldwide for BMW Operating [ADDRESS]. The selection will continue to grow, e.g. with productivity apps such as video conferencing service Zoom.

Design and technology for a unique user and driving experience. The new BMW Panoramic iDrive is scalable and will be integrated into all new BMW models – across all vehicle segments and with all drive system technologies – from the end of 2025.

The driving experience takes centre stage. The driver should feel at ease and have full control over the vehicle. This principle is reflected in the design of the new BMW Panoramic iDrive. Particular attention is paid to the details: the user interface has been designed as intuitively and adaptively as possible to ensure seamless interaction. The result is a holistic experience enhanced by a harmonious combination of sound, light and innovative design. Every journey becomes a special moment of connection between human and vehicle. “Technology and customer preferences are changing more quickly than ever. The design of digital experiences and sound is playing an ever more important role,” says Adrian van Hooydonk, Senior Vice President BMW Group Design. “The new BMW Panoramic iDrive not only makes our vehicles smarter and more user-friendly, it also enables much more extensive personalisation, which turns every new BMW into a car that is very much the user’s own.” Another element in the holistic experience provided by the BMW Panoramic iDrive is the new HypersonX sound experience in the Neue Klasse models. Developed by the BMW Group Sound Design Studio, it comprises 43 sound signals and special driving sounds for Personal Mode and Sport Mode. The multi-dimensional spectrum adapts the sounds precisely to the driving situation at hand and, in so doing, creates an emotional interaction between the driver and their BMW.

#SpiritOf GS: Para el espíritu aventurero. ¿Ya estás planeando tu próxima aventura en moto dentro y fuera de la carretera? Los nuevos productos de la colección #SpiritOfGS son un valioso complemento para la gama de ropa funcional. Por ejemplo, la Chamarra GS Karakum GORE-TEX de tres piezas, disponible en una nueva combinación de colores azul oscuro.

Esto hace que el traje sea especialmente adecuado para su uso fuera de la carretera, mientras que la amplia gama de opciones de personalización adaptarlo a las necesidades individuales. El aspecto moderno se complementa con detalles prácticos como los numerosos bolsillos interiores y los cuatro exteriores, dos de los cuales son impermeables.

La Chamarra y los Pantalones GS Rallye GORE-TEX van un paso más allá.

El dorso textil elástico con gran protección en los nudillos y ribete de piel de cabra es ideal para los rigores del uso off-road. La palma reforzada de piel de canguro también proporciona un agarre máximo.

La Chamarra GS Fleece es perfecta para el tiempo más fresco.

En la combinación de colores Daytona, el casco Grand Prix Racer combina a la perfección con la flamante BMW R 12 S, cuyo color naranja lava metalizado rinde homenaje a la legendaria BMW R 90 S.

La Chamarra Schwabing estará disponible en 2025 en las nuevas combinaciones de colores negro, negro/azul, amarillo/azul para mujer y negro, negro/azul, azul/amarillo para hombres.

El material es extremadamente cómodo y transpirable, mientras que los tres bolsillos exteriores con cremallera y un bolsillo interior ofrecen una gran practicidad.

Los Pantalones Stachus, que deben su nombre a la plaza Stachus del centro de Múnich, tienen un aspecto moderno y sencillo y se ofrecen en negro y caqui. Los seis bolsillos exteriores y los protectores NP3 Flex en rodillas y caderas distinguen a estos pantalones de la ropa de ocio ordinaria. Una cremallera de 40 cm de largo permite conectarlos, por ejemplo, con las chamarras Mitte, Schwabing y Grunewald.

Los clásicos y deportivos Guantes Lehel con rayas de contraste en las nuevas combinaciones de colores negro/azul y gris son el complemento perfecto para el #SoulFuel de ropa #SoulFuel . Están confeccionados en suave piel de vacuno de alta calidad y cuentan con detalles innovadores.

#PluggedToLife: equipamiento elegante para motociclistas de gran utilidad para el día a día. Con la colección #PluggedToLife , BMW Motorrad ofrece productos prácticos y elegantes que no sólo son ideales para el motociclismo, sino también absolutamente adecuados para el uso diario cuando te bajas de la moto. Por ejemplo, al ir de compras, pasear por la ciudad o ir a una cafetería.

Para la temporada 2025, el Casco Sao Paulo está disponible en los nuevos colores Ampere y Fuse. El moderno casco jet es elegante, cómodo y, con su visera larga y el parasol integrado, un compañero seguro en la ciudad y en las zonas urbanas. Los elementos de ventilación que se pueden cerrar en la parte superior de la cabeza y en el spoiler evitan la acumulación de calor.

La Chamarra Bilbao, que combina estilo y funcionalidad, es otra novedad para 2025 y está confeccionada con un tejido ligero y transpirable disponible en naranja y azul oscuro. Con un sencillo corte blusón, queda bien tanto en la ciudad como en los senderos. Los protectores NP Flex 3D en hombros y codos proporcionan la seguridad necesaria.

La Chamarra Naples también es nueva para 2025. Está disponible en azul y antracita. Tiene un diseño atemporal y deportivo.

El tejido es cómodo y transpirable y dispone de tres bolsillos exteriores con cremallera y un bolsillo interior para mantener tus objetos esenciales al alcance de la mano.

Las Zapatillas Seoul GORE-TEX , que estarán disponibles en negro, azul y verde para la próxima temporada, son más que elegantes.

Le Castellet. The start of the Endurance Cup season of the GT World Challenge Europe powered by AWS could hardly have gone better from the perspective of BMW M Motorsport. The new BMW M4 GT3 EVO achieved an overall victory, a class win, and a podium finish in every category at the 6 Hours of Paul Ricard at Le Castellet (FRA). The Team WRT trio of Charles Weerts, Ugo de Wilde (both BEL), and Kelvin van der Linde (RSA) celebrated their race win on the podium. In the Silver Cup, Paradine Competition drove the #992 BMW M4 GT3 EVO to victory, while car #991 finished second in the Bronze Cup. In the Gold Cup, AlManar Racing by Team WRT secured third place .

The #32 BMW M4 GT3 EVO started the race from ninth position but steadily improved throughout the race. As darkness fell and the track cooled down, the car got faster, and about 1:45 hours before the end, van der Linde took the lead which he confidently maintained until the finish. The South African celebrated his second prestigious victory with Team WRT after the [ADDRESS] Hour (AUS). It was also a particularly special triumph for Ugo de Wilde, as he managed to win right away in his debut as a BMW M works driver.

The Le Castellet race was a complete success for the BMW M Motorsport teams beyond the overall victory. Paradine Competition had double reason to celebrate. In the Silver Cup, the victory went to the #992 BMW M4 GT3 EVO driven by James Kellett, Charles Clark (both GBR), and Pedro Ebrahim (BRA). In the Bronze Cup, BMW M works driver Dan Harper, team owner Darren Leung (both GBR), and Sean Gelael (INA) in the #991 car finished second. In the Gold Cup, BMW M works driver Jens Klingmann (GER), Ben Tuck (GBR), and Al Faisal Al Zubair (OMA) in the #777 BMW M4 GT3 EVO from AlManar Racing by Team WRT celebrated a third-place finish.

ROWE Racing, starting from 13 th place with the #98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, made a strong comeback and finished the race in sixth place with drivers Augusto Farfus (BRA), Jesse Krohn (FIN), and Raffaele Marciello (SUI). Century Motorsport finished fifth in the Silver Cup with car #42. Team WRT's car #30 and BMW Italia Ceccato Racing's car #15 retired early.

Comments after the race.

Andreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “Congratulations to Team WRT on their opening victory in the GT World Challenge Europe! The drivers Charles Weerts, Kelvin van der Linde, and Ugo de Wilde can be very proud of their performances. Ugo de Wilde won his first race as a BMW M works driver right away – that's fantastic! Overall, our BMW M4 GT3 EVO made an excellent debut in this prestigious racing series. Many thanks to everyone involved at BMW M Motorsport and the teams that made these successes possible! We celebrated the overall win and a class victory, and stood on the podium with a crew in every class. Congratulations to Paradine Competition and AlManar Racing by Team WRT. Our record in Le Castellet is truly impressive.”

Björn Lellmann (Head of Customer Racing at BMW M Motorsport): “I am thrilled; it was a fantastic race for customer racing with the BMW M4 GT3 EVO. This morning in qualifying, it didn't look like we would be going home with a podium in almost all classes. Jens Klingmann fought for the win in the Gold category until the end, and Darren Leung's team can be proud of their victory in the Silver class and second place in the Bronze category. All teams and drivers did a great job at the start of the GT World Challenge. I hope it continues like this.”

Vincent Vosse (WRT Team Principal): “ Again, it was great teamwork! For a bit of history, we haven’t won here since 2012 and we’ve been close a few times but always a bit unlucky. To be able to achieve this strong result is mega. I’m super happy for Ugo who did his first race with us! It is such a nice way to start and to take off a little bit of pressure. I’m of course very sorry for car #30, those things happen in racing. Until then they were doing quite well. A great job from #777 with their 3 rd place in Gold Cup. A great start of the season!”

Charles Weerts (#32 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT, 1 st place): “A very good weekend, I’m very happy! We didn’t expect it at all but it’s the kind of surprise we love to have. The team did an amazing job, our car was really nice to drive, so a big thank you to the team and to BMW M Motorsport but also my two teammates. First time we drove together, and we got a win straight away. Super proud and super happy to be driving with them. Let’s try to keep it going like we did and I’m sure we will have a successful year.”

Kelvin van der Linde (#32 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT, 1 st place): “It was a very surprising win for us. After qualifying our main target was to finish in the top-five and to score points, but to be fighting for a podium and even a win was unexpected and makes it even sweeter. Big shout out to Charles, he’s been really good. I think it’s one of hist best drives. Same for Ugo that we threw in a deep end in such a competitive championship, and he did really well. He made no mistakes, and he established him well this weekend. I’m looking forward to seeing how he progresses throughout the season.”

Ugo de Wilde (#32 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT, 1 st place): “Round one is done, and I can’t believe what has just happened! It’s amazing to start my journey with BMW M Motorsport with a win. It was a really educational weekend for me, it was great to finally start racing with Charles, Kelvin and Team WRT. It was not easy at the start and we were not expecting to finish on the podium. We will keep working and try to focus on Monza then on the biggest one, 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps. Thanks a lot to BMW M Motorsport and to WRT!”

Augusto Farfus (#98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, ROWE Racing, 6 th place): “We had literally everything in this race. All kinds of possible things did not go our way but in the end we brought it home despite the issues that we had which was good. But for BMW M Motorsport it was an incredible weekend. The wins and podium finishes show how strong the EVO car is and we have enough reason to celebrate.”

Jens Klingmann (#777 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, AlManar Racing by Team WRT, 3 rd place Gold Cup): “Super happy to kick off the season with a podium. I think the top-ten overall with our Gold Cup car is an amazing result. We didn’t have the pace in the end to fight for more even though we were so close to P2, but P1 was out of reach. I think we can be proud and happy with what we achieved tonight. We executed everything very well. The harmony in the team and in our driver crew is really good. I can’t wait for the rest of the season.”

Darren Leung (Team Principal and driver Paradine Competition): “First race for our Silver car and the first time we were running two cars, so I am extremely happy that the first result is a class win. I am very proud of everyone involved. Unfortunately for the 991 we had three full course yellows that helped our competitors otherwise we could have won that, too. All in all todays results I think are a very good sign for the season to come.”

Dan Harper (#991 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paradine Competition, 2 nd place Bronze Cup): “It was a challenging weekend from the start. We lacked a bit of pace at the beginning of the weekend. However, in the end, we had a brilliant race, securing a podium finish. We came close to a victory, but the full course yellow periods played in favour of our competitors. That's how it goes sometimes, but considering our practice sessions and qualifying performance, we can be very pleased with this podium result. Thank you to the whole Paradine team, they did a great job.”

# MINI and Paul Smith at the Japan Mobility Show 2025.
## MINI presents the next milestone in its cooperation with Paul Smith in Tokyo whilst showcasing their current model range.
Date: 2025-10-15 | Author: Silas Thelen BMW Group | ID: T0453179EN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Munich / Tokyo. The Japan Mobility Show 2025 becomes the stage for the latest milestone in the long-standing collaboration between MINI and British designer Paul Smith. It will be unveiled as part of the BMW Group Keynote on 29 October 2025 at 09:55 (JST) at the BMW Group stand, based in the West Exhibition Hall of the show.

MINI and Paul Smith: A creative success story.

The MINI Paul Smith Edition is a new chapter in the success story of the two British brands. The long-lasting relationship began in 1998, when the designer wrapped a Classic Mini Cooper in his trademark visual design. To mark the 40th anniversary of the Classic Mini in 1999, the designer lent his characteristic Paul Smith "Signature Stripe" to a one-off model. After two further one-offs - the MINI Strip in 2021 and the MINI Recharged by Paul Smith in 2022 - Paul Smith's design language returns to MINI.

MINI model portfolio.

As part of the BMW Group stand at the Japan Mobility Show, MINI is presenting the diverse range of its current product portfolio. The MINI Cooper family is represented by showcasing the MINI Cooper SE, which combines heritage, technology and driving pleasure. Whilst providing a fully electric go-kart feeling via the 218 hp electric powertrain. Also present will be the MINI [ADDRESS]-door S, which combines compact dimensions and agility whilst showcasing increased practicality when compared to its 3-door siblings. A MINI Cooper Convertible will also be on show, which presents open-air driving in the spirit of its ‘Always Open’ philosophy: agile, spontaneous and full of driving pleasure.Launched earlier this year, the MINI John Cooper Works Aceman outlines its sporty all-electric useable performance from the John Cooper Works sub-brand. The latest model in the MINI family presents itself as a versatile companion and not only demonstrates MINIs typical "Clever Use of Space" - but also brings a powerful driving experience to the road as a performance-enhanced version thanks to 258 hp produced from the 54.2 kWh electric battery. Finally, the MINI Countryman S ALL 4 will also be present on the BMW Group stand at the Japan Mobility Show: as the largest of the MINI family, the car offers generous space and fits in perfectly for those looking for longer adventures and spontaneous exploring.

Japan Mobility Show.

The Japan Mobility Show is regarded as one of the most important international platforms for pioneering mobility concepts. From [ADDRESS] to [ADDRESS], over 130 exhibitors will be presenting their innovations to visitors and press at the Tokyo Big Sight exhibition centre - making the Japanese capital the centre for visions of tomorrow's mobility.

# BMW Group maintains BEV growth path in challenging market situation in 2024
## ++ BMW Group: Significant +13.5% sales growth in fully-electric vehicles +++ With over 2.45 million units delivered, BMW Group meets adjust-ed sales target for 2024 +++ BMW brand increases sales in selected regions, gains market shares and maintains position as global segment leader +++ [EXECUTIVE_OFFICER]: “BEV growth to continue in 2025” +++
Date: 2025-01-13 | Author: Sina Unger BMW Group | ID: T0447427EN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Munich. The BMW Group managed to continue its growth path in 2024, delivering a total of 426.594 fully-electric vehicles to customers and achieving BEV-sales growth of +13.5%. Both BMW and MINI brands posted double-digit BEV growth, with 368,523 (+11.6%) and 56,181 (+24.3%) fully-electric vehicles delivered to customers, respectively. The Rolls-Royce brand also recorded significant growth with 1.890 BEV vehicles delivered ([CONTACT_PHONE]%). The BMW brand managed to increase deliveries across all vehicle drivetrains in all sales regions outside of China.

“ The BMW Group is maintaining its growth trajectory for fully-electric vehicles amid challenging market conditions. This is reflected in both the significant sales growth for fully-electric vehicles and the clear rise in new BEV orders in Europe,” said [EXECUTIVE_OFFICER], member of the Board of Management of BMW AG responsible for Customer, Brands, Sales. “ We are confident we can maintain our BEV sales growth in 2025 with our strong and expanded product line-up ,” Goller continued.

While BMW Group deliveries for the first half of 2024 were in line with the previous year, sales performance in the second half of the year was impacted by delivery stops in connection with the Integrated Brake System (IBS), as well as subdued demand in China. The BMW Group therefore adjusted its sales guidance for the full year. With a total of 2,450,804 vehicles delivered to customers in 2024, the BMW Group achieved this new sales target. Electrified vehicles represented 24.2% of total BMW Group sales in 2024, with 593,215 units delivered to customers. Fully-electric vehicles accounted for 17.4% of total sales.

The BMW brand delivered 2,200,177 vehicles to customers in the full year 2024 (-2.3%). With its attractive product portfolio across all technologies, the brand maintained its position as the global leader in its segment. In the Europe region, the BMW brand expanded its market share, registering double-digit sales growth in Italy, France and the UK. The BMW brand also posted sales growth in the US. In Germany, despite a declining market for fully-electric vehicles, BMW saw growth in new BEV registrations.

With a total of 206,582 vehicles delivered to customers in 2024, M GmbH sales grew by +2.1%, reaching a new all-time high. The MINI brand, which updated its entire product range last year, sold 244,915 units worldwide (-17.1%). In the fourth quarter, the brand almost doubled its BEV sales year-on-year, with 29,698 fully-electric vehicles sold. The Rolls-Royce brand delivered 5,712 units to customers (-5.3%) in the full year. During the same period, BMW Motorrad sold 210.408 motorcycles and scooters (+0.6%) and thus achieved another record year.

# New exclusive variant of the BMW X3 with extended wheelbase set for market launch.
## +++ Luxurious levels of space and high-quality equipment with an array of exclusive details for the Chinese market +++ From China, for China: local development and production at Plant Lydia conserves resources and optimises logistics +++
Date: 2025-02-14 | Author: Johannes Lacher BMW Group | ID: T0448079EN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Munich. The latest version of the BMW X3 is poised for market launch in China. The country’s most successful Sports Activity Vehicle will arrive at Chinese dealerships in just a few days and will go on sale later in February 2025.

Drive system: two petrol engines to choose from.

This exclusive version of the BMW X3 was developed and will be produced specifically for the Chinese market to meet the exacting expectations of customers in the high-growth SAV segment. The outgoing model was the strongest-selling BMW vehicle worldwide in 2023. 156,000 units were delivered in China alone – accounting for around 40 per cent of all BMW X model sales in the region.

The new BMW X3 will be launched in China with two engine variants. Customers can choose from a pair of four-cylinder petrol engines: the BMW X3 xDrive 25L Luxury develops 140 kW (190 hp) and maximum torque of 310 Nm (229 lb-ft). This is enough to accelerate from 0-100 km/h (62 mph) in 8.7 seconds on the way to a top speed of 214 km/h (133 mph). The even more dynamic BMW X3 xDrive 30L – available in the equipment variants Pioneering MSP and Exclusive MSP – generates 190 kW (258 hp) and peak torque of 400 Nm (295 lb-ft), and sprints from rest to 100 km/h (62 mph) in just 6.5 seconds. Top speed is 239 km/h (148 mph).

Longer wheelbase, more space, more comfort. Alongside its BMW-typical sporting ability, the new SAV for the premium midsize class majors on high quality and comfort. For the first time, the version of the BMW X3 produced in China for China has an extended wheelbase. Yet it also retains the 50:50 weight distribution for which BMW is renowned, which results in almost perfect balance and therefore top-class handling. In addition, the 111-millimetre-longer wheelbase ensures even smoother and even more stable driving characteristics. And once inside, passengers can enjoy a significantly enhanced feeling of space.

This extra spaciousness is particularly noticeable in the rear compartment. Here, kneeroom has increased by a full 96 millimetres and legroom to over a metre. The new BMW X3 with extended wheelbase is 126 millimetres longer than the predecessor model and 25 millimetres wider. Its exterior length of 4,865 millimetres and width of 1,920 millimetres also mean it has the largest dimensions of any vehicle in its segment. However, it still has the hallmark proportions of a BMW X model, complete with a long roofline flowing smoothly into the rear end and a dynamically stretched silhouette.

Generous and exclusive equipment with a host of highlights. The luxurious driving experience is complemented by the high-quality and exclusive specification of the new BMW X3. Playing a prominent role here are the standard features enhanced by an array of market-specific details. Thanks to the new BMW iDrive based on BMW Operating [ADDRESS], customers in China benefit from a large number of exclusive digital services. The content of the BMW Digital Premium offering has been adapted precisely to the particular requirements and demands of customers in the Chinese market.

The exterior also stars with exclusive details for the Chinese market. Both model variants come as standard with BMW Iconic Glow contour lighting, which shows off the BMW kidney grille to eye-catching effect. The range of colour shades available comprises five exquisite metallic paint finishes, including a particularly striking Frozen variant that gives the car a visually impactful presence.

From China, for China: local production brings many benefits. The two BMW X3 variants are tailored more keenly than ever to the preferences of discerning target groups in China. The vehicle concept, design, technology and equipment have all been adapted as required with no change to the prices asked for the predecessor model. BMW has also focused on its Shenyang base in China when it comes to development and production. The new BMW X3 models will be built at Plant Lydia, which BMW operates in tandem with its joint venture BMW Brilliance Automotive (BBA) and which employs cutting-edge, resource-conserving and efficient production methods. Local production also reduces transportation distances, optimises logistics and actively contributes to greater sustainability.

Speech [EXECUTIVE_OFFICER], Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG

Ladies and gentlemen,

This year’s IAA MOBILITY impressively demonstrates that the desire for individual mobility has never been stronger. Today, more than ever, global success depends on the ability to master new technologies and to anticipate what customers around the world want.

It also takes courage to make bold leaps. A pioneering spirit – to explore new paths. Confidence in your own abilities. And resilience – to stay the course, even in the face of headwinds. And on top it requires a team of nearly 160,000 employees who are passionate about shaping the future of mobility. Then evolution becomes revolution. Vision becomes reality.

You’ll remember that, back in 2021, I promised we would lead BMW into a new era. With the NEUE KLASSE . Today, we deliver on that promise.

Early this decade, we recognized an opportunity; a chance to set new benchmarks across all relevant technologies in the car. It was an opportunity that only comes once in a lifetime. The perfect BMW moment.

The NEUE KLASSE is much more than just a new vehicle. It marks a completely new model generation. A massive leap that redefines the entire brand.

The new BMW iX3 will be followed by more than 40 new or updated BMW models by 2027. Each will have the NEUE KLASSE genes – regardless of the drivetrain. More than any other project, the NEUE KLASSE represents the innovative spirit of all our associates. Across all our brands.

On behalf of the entire company, it is my great honor to unveil:

The new BMW iX3 !

Ladies and gentlemen,

I’ve been with the BMW Group for 34 years. I’ve witnessed many world premieres and bold technological innovations. But a vehicle like this is something you experience only once. All of us at the BMW Group have been working tirelessly towards this moment.

With the NEUE KLASSE, we’ve created an unprecedented interplay of multiple, ground-breaking technologies. Now, we are taking Sheer Driving Pleasure to a whole new level. In short: The NEUE KLASSE is more BMW than ever.

And the next highlight is already waiting in the wings. Early next year, we will unveil the second model of the NEUE KLASSE – a sporty sedan at the very core of the brand:

the new all-electric BMW i3 .

Ladies and gentlemen,

From the drivetrain to battery technology and driving dynamics, from the operating system to the digital user experience: We’ve elevated every single aspect to the next level for the NEUE KLASSE.

With this new design language , we’ve even skipped a whole generation. And there's no one better to explain how our customers will experience this with all their senses than Adrian van Hooydonk.

Speech Adrian van Hooydonk, Head of BMW Group Design

Welcome ladies and gentlemen!

Yes, the big moment has finally come. As Oliver mentioned, with the Neue Klasse we are taking very big steps in technology. These bigger steps in technology can only become meaningful hand in hand with big steps in design. The BMW iX3 has a much bigger range helped by a very clean shape with excellent aerodynamics.

In the interior you will find a new display concept that allowed us to clean-up the dashboard and completely redefine the driving experience.

But let‘s look at the exterior design first: We have typical solid BMW SAV proportions with a lot of presence and emphasis on all four wheels. The surfaces are very clean with only a few precise lines. The front-end shows a new interpretation of the BMW typical face in which we replace chrome with light. Vertically oriented kidneys match the more upright overall appearance of our SAV. This new light signature is part of the daytime running light and it will make the new BMW iX3 very recognizable by day and by night. Overall, the car has a very solid stance and strong shoulders and, in the rear, again a new light signature that emphasizes the width of the car.

In the interior you will find that the driving experience is and will remain our focus, putting the driver at ease and in control! The key element to this is our all-new BMW Panoramic Vision which projects in the bottom of the windscreen and builds upon our years of experience with head-up displays. This new display is visible for all passengers on board and will allow you to quickly check the information you want and need while keeping your hands on the wheel and your focus on the road ahead. Together with our new free cut central display and iconic steering wheel these elements are the corner stones of our new Panoramic

iDrive system , a whole new driving experience that you will find in all our future BMW models from now on!

This new user experience already starts when you approach the car and continues as you get in and set the car up to your personal preferences. With My Modes you can do that very easily and select a perfectly curated driving experience – from screen content or colors to light and sound and even driving characteristics.

So, our new Operating System X focuses on the best driving experience but will also allow you a much higher level of personalization making your new BMW truly yours! Overall, the new digital aspects of our cars will make them more intelligent and easier to use.

At the same time, this has allowed us to design much cleaner and warmer interiors, creating very personal living environments on four wheels. The interior trim “ Digital White ” is spacious and modern.

So, starting with the BMW iX3 we are introducing a new form language that will lead to a new look and feel for the entire BMW brand. Our designs will be very clean and at the same time very strong in character, but above all: more BMW than ever!

Thank you very much!

Speech [EXECUTIVE_OFFICER], Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Customer, Brands, Sales

Thank you, Adrian!

Ladies and gentlemen,

Let’s now move on to MINI , which celebrated its very own game-changing moment already last year with the introduction of a completely new product range.

The “ New MINI Family ”, covering the most desirable and broad product portfolio in the brand's history, now features four very distinct models - Convertible, Cooper, Aceman and Countryman . And regarding the drivetrain, MINI customers of course have the choice between all-electric or highly efficient combustion engines.

Clever use of space, wheels at the corner, go-cart feeling, combined with true Britishness and maximum individuality. That's how MINI became the world's most successful premium small car brand. Driving a MINI has always been a confident personal statement. In this way, MINI has inspired numerous celebrities and designers throughout its 66-years long history.

And today, we are writing the next exciting chapter in this tradition. Partnering with a brand that stands for customization and thinking out of the box like few others. I am talking about Deus Ex Machina !

The outcome of this inspiring and exceptional partnership are two stunning John Cooper Works models – fraternal twins with very different styles, yet united by a shared enthusiasm.

I brought one of them with me today, so, let’s have a look.

Ladies and gentlemen,

“The Skeg.” A distinctive and contemporary re-interpretation of MINI's racing history. Pure. Bold. Innovative. This artwork on four wheels is based on the MINI John Cooper Works Electric . Inspired by the world of surfing, it offers pure electric freedom to enjoy the MINI go-cart feeling on coastal roads.

His twin – “ The Machina ” – is forged on the racetrack. Lean, fast and powered by a combustion engine, it embodies raw racing technology and authentic functionality.

Together, they stand for individual lifestyle and maximum driving excitement, regardless of the respective drive train.

Similar to what our customers can experience with the New MINI Family , which is winning over new and old customers worldwide.

That is especially true for our fully electric models. Today, already one in three MINIs has an electric heart. And the trend continues to rise.

Ladies and gentlemen,

Collaborations like the one with Deus Ex Machina are just one example for unique customization – the way only MINI can do.

And now, ladies and gentlemen, to something completely different.

Speech Markus Flasch, CEO BMW Motorrad

Ladies and gentlemen,

It is a great pleasure for me to present the BMW Motorrad Vision CE . It offers the most spectacular insight into our vision of future of urban

e-mobility that we have ever developed. For me, the Vision CE is a clear proof to our ambition to shape the future of emission-free mobility with courage and a pioneering spirit.

Highly innovative single-track urban mobility has been strongly anchored in the history of BMW Motorrad for decades. We revolutionized urban mobility already 25 years ago with the unique BMW C1 . In 2014, we were the first manufacturer to combine outstanding design with an e-drive in the BMW C evolution . In 2022, we launched the CE 04 , a design & technology masterpiece of emission-free mobility which remains the global market leader in its segment to this day.

At BMW Motorrad, the development of single-track e-mobility clearly stands for visionary concepts, innovation leadership and groundbreaking design. With the Vision CE's special self-balancing system, we are looking to the future and setting again new standards: Urban riding fun on two wheels without having to wear a helmet or motorcycle clothing, thanks to the unique structural bracket design.

The Vision CE – one like no other: Exciting and inspiring - just like BMW Motorrad!

Speech [EXECUTIVE_OFFICER], Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG

Ladies and gentlemen,

At the BMW Group, we are constantly reshaping mobility – just as we have for nearly 110 years. Our customers’ individual needs, wishes – and, yes, their dreams – are always at the heart of all our brands.

All of our customers benefit from our innovative approaches and the latest technologies. At the same time, we are steering the company on a long-term path that is in line with the Paris Agreement.

This is the spirit that drives us at the BMW Group.

# BMW NA 50th Anniversary | 50 Stories for 50 Years [ADDRESS]: “Replacing an Icon: The [ADDRESS] Series Arrives in the US”.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When BMW of North America took over sales and distribution from Max Hoffman on [ADDRESS], 1975, the 2002 had been part of BMW’s US lineup for more than seven years. With its agile handling and high-revving engine, the 2002 had given BMW an enthusiastic following, and it had been crucial to establishing the US as BMW’s largest export market worldwide.

Even the most highly-regarded cars become outdated, and the 2002 was no exception. The car’s design had been finalized in 1965, and it looked decidedly old-fashioned a decade later. The 2002 had been slated for replacement in the 1974 model year, but its production cycle was extended when its planned successor—a two-door hatchback rather than a sedan—was rejected by BMW’s sales and marketing team led by Bob Lutz. While that car was restyled, the 2002 was updated with rectangular taillights and, in the US, larger bumpers as mandated by new Federal regulations. In this market, the 2002 was also equipped with revised emissions equipment that would ensure compliance through 1976.

In August of that year, the 2002’s replacement finally arrived. The first 3 Series, known internally as the E21, featured forward-looking styling from BMW design chief Paul Bracq over familiar mechanical elements. US customers were offered just one model: the 320i, equipped with the fuel-injected 2.0-liter M10 four cylinder engine that had powered the 2002 tii, mated once again to a four-speed Getrag manual or three-speed ZF automatic.

In the meantime, however, US emissions standards had tightened still further, and the equipment installed to meet those standards reduced performance. Where the 2002 tii’s fuel-injected M10 had delivered 130 horsepower and 130 pound-feet , the same engine in the 320i put out a disappointing 110 horsepower and 112 pound-feet.

That alone would make the 320i a tough sell to performance-oriented customers looking to replace their 2002s, but BMW of North America’s public relations manager Tom McGurn had a plan to cultivate their good will. As the launch of the 320i drew near, McGurn gave members of the BMW Automobile Club of America (ACA) the opportunity to be first in the country to drive the new 3 Series.

“We had to get the cars to Carefree, Arizona for the press launch, and we had to get miles on the cars, so what better way to do that?” McGurn said. “It was as cost-effective as trucking the cars, and we’d get club members’ feedback. Hopefully, they’d start to fall in like if not in love with the new car.”

In November 1976, a dozen new 3 Series set out from Los Angeles with ACA members behind the wheel, many with a spouse or friend in the passenger seat. All were enthusiastic drivers, and their spirited pace attracted the attention of the California Highway Patrol. “A whole phalanx of these cars were pulled over to be given California Performance Awards,” aka speeding tickets, said club member Roger Scilley, who drove one 320i with his wife, Delight Lucas. “I think seven of us got stopped by the CHP all at once near Thermal!” laughed Wayne Wundram, another ACA member.

Despite that inconvenience, the 320 was a hit. “Club members were ecstatic, and now I had contact with 30 or 40 people based around a really fun experience,” McGurn said. “There was some nitpicking about the car, but it was constructive criticism. The overall reaction was very good.”

In Arizona, the cars would be driven by some of the journalists who’d made the 2002 a success, including Car and Driver editor David E. Davis Jr., recently returned to journalism after several years in the advertising business. Davis liked the car, though he and many enthusiasts noted handling quirks—a tendency to lift the inside-rear wheel under hard cornering—that were greatly reduced with the introduction of the better-equipped 320iS a few years into E21 production.

“There was a lot of skepticism, a lot of nostalgia for the 2002, even sometimes without real experience of the car, because it was an icon,” McGurn said. “We had a long drive, and they came back very impressed. I think it fulfilled the promise of the Ultimate Driving Machine. It was fun to drive, and it had all the qualities that BMW was legendary for. The initial reviews by the enthusiast magazines were very positive.”

The buying public responded positively, too. Though some of BMW’s most hardcore customers opted to stick with their well-developed 2002s, lamenting the absence of the six-cylinder 323i offered in Europe, the 320i attracted a broad new audience that allowed BMW of North America to set new sales records every year from 1976 to 1983. Thanks in no small part to the energetic modern styling of the 320i, BMW became the must-have car among the Young Urban Professionals known as Yuppies. That would reveal itself as a curse a decade later, but in the meantime BMW was happy to be the car of choice among this influential and free-spending demographic.

Munich/Basel. In 2025, BMW celebrates 50 years of BMW Art Cars. To connect this legacy with the present, former Art Car juror Hans Ulrich Obrist and BMW have invited renowned artist Alvaro Barrington to transform the BMW Hydrogen VIP car fleet into a moving artwork during Art Basel in Basel 2025. This marks the second year in a row that the BMW iX5 Hydrogen fleet has been in operation at the art fair, following last year’s successful debut featuring the artwork of British artist Es Devlin.

BMW has been Official Automotive Partner of Art Basel globally for over two decades, supporting creative voices that shape contemporary culture. Barrington was selected by curator Hans Ulrich Obrist, former member of the BMW Art Car jury, in line with the brand’s heritage of engaging with pioneering artistic perspectives. The resulting work, titled “Simply, 2025”, envelops the BMW iX5 Hydrogen fleet in Barrington’s distinctive visual language.

As a tribute to BMW’s pioneering work in innovative mobility, Barrington has reimagined the fleet of BMW iX5 Hydrogen vehicles with a striking wrap that reflects his signature collage aesthetic. Inspired by figures of cultural reinvention such as David Hockney, Richard Hamilton, Henri Matisse and Tina Turner, Barrington explores how mobility itself is evolving – not just in form, but in its emotional and cultural resonance.

Drawing on in-depth conversations with BMW’s hydrogen engineers, Barrington’s concept bridges technology and humanity. Using a vivid palette and layered forms, his artwork expresses themes of transformation, nature, and technological innovation. The wrap fuses artistic vision with design precision, symbolising a future where mobility is not only sustainable but also emotionally intelligent and culturally integrated.

Alvaro Barrington says: “Driving culture is one of the most important cultures in the world – billions of people participate in it. As an artist who is supposed to be involved in cultural production, it’s really interesting to be a part of this conversation about sustainability and the future of cars that BMW and the rest of the world is having.”

Alvaro Barrington’s practice, rooted in painting but extending into multimedia and textiles, examines how materials carry cultural, political and personal histories. His BMW iX5 Hydrogen collaboration marks a significant moment in this journey, channelling his curiosity about the human-centric potential of technology and dynamic vision into motion through the medium of innovative transport in a joyful way.

Central to the collaboration is the BMW iX5 Hydrogen – a vehicle that showcases the brand’s pioneering role in innovative mobility and technology. As part of BMW’s presence at Art Basel in Basel 2025, the fleet will serve as the VIP car service alongside the fully electric BMW i7, reinforcing BMW’s commitment to contemporary luxury, innovation, and exclusive driving experiences.

"The collaboration with Alvaro Barrington amplifies our pioneering fuel-cell technology through the lens of art," says Michael Rath, Head of Hydrogen Vehicles, BMW Group . "We are firmly committed to launching our first hydrogen-powered vehicle in 2028."

First hydrogen-powered BMW production model in 2028. As part of its holistic approach and after the successful global testing of the pilot fleet of BMW iX5 Hydrogen vehicles, BMW is now preparing to start the series production of vehicles with hydrogen drivetrain in 2028. The series production models will be integrated into BMW’s existing portfolio, i.e. BMW will offer an existing model in an additional hydrogen fuel cell drive system variant. As fuel cell technology is another electric vehicle technology, the BMW Group explicitly views it as complementing the drive technology used by battery electric vehicles (BEV) and next to plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) and internal combustion engines (ICE).

The BMW VIP car service fleet, featuring Barrington’s custom-wrapped BMW iX5 Hydrogen cars, can be seen on the streets of Basel during the fair, from 19 to 22 June 2025. The project affirms BMW’s position at the intersection of contemporary luxury, innovation, joy and artistic expression.

Earlier this year, as part of the BMW Art Car World Tour , BMW presented another artist-designed vehicle during the Market Art Fair in Stockholm . German artist Gregor Hildebrandt wrapped a fleet of fully electric BMW i5 and i7 models with his distinctive visual language, turning them into mobile artworks on the streets of the Swedish capital. Further artist collaborations and custom vehicle wraps are set to follow throughout the global tour.

+++ New Scholarship House at the University of Maryland in College Park provides space for 38 scholars +++ All proceeds from the BMW Championship benefit the Evans Scholars Foundation +++ Support has exceeded $60 million since 2007 +++ BMW Chief People and Places Officer [EXECUTIVE_OFFICER]: “Sports and education are the foundation for equal opportunities and social participation” +++

College Park. This week, the BMW Championship is taking place at the Caves Valley Golf Club (Owings Mills, Maryland, USA). As the penultimate playoff tournament of the PGA TOUR, featuring the top 50 players in the season standings (FedExCup), it is one of the most prestigious golf events worldwide. Beyond the competitive battle for the coveted title and qualification for the season final, the BMW Championship focuses on its commitment to education. All profits from the tournament benefit the Evans Scholars Foundation (ESF) of the event organizer, Western Golf Association (WGA). Since the inaugural BMW Championship in 2007, the tournament has raised more than $60 million and helped award more than 4,000 full tuition and housing college scholarships for caddies.

The commitment of the ESF and the support provided by the BMW Championship are life-changing for the scholars who would otherwise be unable to afford a college education. At the University of Maryland in College Park, just north of the U.S. capital Washington, up to 38 additional young caddies will have the opportunity to study and live on campus free of charge. At the start of BMW Championship week, the WGA, in the presence of [EXECUTIVE_OFFICER], Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, People and Places, along with other special guests, Maryland Evans Scholars and their families, inaugurated the new “Caves Valley Golf Club Evans Scholarship House”.

“The BMW Group believes that sports and education form the foundation for equal opportunities and social participation – and the Evans Scholars Foundation is a marvelous initiative working precisely in this direction,” said [EXECUTIVE_OFFICER]. “The empowering force of education is the key to a self-determined future. We are proud of our longstanding partnership with the Western Golf Association, and of the great impact that the BMW Championship makes in the lives of so many young scholars.”

[ADDRESS],000-square-foot Scholarship House features two levels of space for studying and recreation. In addition to featuring a state-of-the-art living and learning environment, the facility has the capacity to house 38 scholars. The foundation for this project was laid during the 2021 BMW Championship, which also took place at the Caves Valley Golf Club. Four years ago, this initiative was brought into focus, and through the collaboration of all parties involved, it was successfully realized in such a short time.

“This Scholarship House represents a tremendous opportunity not only for the 21 Evans Scholars who will attend Maryland this fall, but for generations of promising caddies to come,” said WGA Chairman Steve Colnitis. “Today marks the beginning of the next bright chapter for the Evans Scholars at the University of Maryland.”

This fall, a record 1,260 Evans Scholars will be enrolled at 27 leading universities nationwide. There are more than 12,500 Evans Scholars Alumni since the Program began in 1930.

The support of the ESF through the BMW Championship is part of the BMW Group global commitment in golf for equal opportunities. Through its “Eagles for Education” initiative, the BMW Group supports the Golf Foundation at the BMW PGA Championship (England) and the Philipp Lahm Foundation for Sport and Education at the BMW International Open (Germany). When it comes to its the global amateur tournament series, the BMW Golf Cup, the BMW Group collaborates with JOBLINGE in Germany and with UNICEF at the World Final under the “Eagles for Education” initiative.

# BMW Motorrad presents the BMW F 450 GS.
## Playful in handling, versatile in use – ultimate GS expertise for the 48 hp class.
Date: 2025-11-04 | Author: Juliane Dresler BMW Group | ID: T0453742EN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"With the new BMW F 450 GS, BMW Motorrad presents a genuine BMW GS in the 48 hp A2 class. It embodies the essence of a GS: Get on, twist the throttle, have fun - with full control and maximum confidence. Its low weight, superior performance and perfect balance between agility and stability ensure a particularly intuitive riding experience. Thanks to its precise handling and typical GS expertise, it performs impressively both on and off the road. The F 450 GS is the perfect 'best buddy' for every riding situation. It is uncomplicated, robust, and always ready. It sets the benchmark for sporty adventure bikes in its class." Markus Flasch, CEO BMW Motorrad

The new BMW F 450 GS: BMW GS expertise in the 48 hp A2 class in the iconic BMW GS design. The new BMW F 450 GS marks the next step in the GS model family, specifically addressing the 48 hp A2 class with proven GS technology and iconic design.

At the EICMA international motorcycle show, BMW Motorrad gave a preview of a fully-fledged GS model already in 2024, which specifically addresses the steadily growing market segment of medium-sized displacement motorcycles.

The series version of the BMW F 450 GS consistently lives up to this claim: It is a versatile all-rounder that combines everyday usability, sporty dynamic performance, touring comfort, and off-road capabilities. In the "GS Trophy" equipment variant, it follows in the footsteps of the concept vehicle. It adopts its striking design language and high-quality, high-tech components, including magnesium parts for maximum performance and low weight.

With its balanced power-to-torque ratio, low weight, and characteristic GS ergonomics, the F 450 GS provides riding fun and confidence from the first meter. The new F 450 GS thus combines the classic GS spirit with a modern, accessible, and simultaneously powerful approach.

"With the BMW F 450 GS, we are addressing a particularly broad target audience. This motorcycle is aimed at anyone who values maximum agility, versatility, pure riding pleasure, and cutting-edge technology – regardless of whether they are on the road every day, on long tours, or simply looking for a light, dynamic, and uncomplicated bike. The current trend toward downsizing, i.e., switching from heavy motorcycles to compact and versatile machines, demonstrates the great interest in this segment. The F 450 GS offers the ideal combination of playful handling, maneuverability, riding dynamics, and high-quality equipment – without compromising on quality or technical performance.” Astrid Neudecker, Product Manager BMW F 450 GS.

The BMW Easy Ride Clutch (ERC) is a technical highlight and a further development of a centrifugal clutch. This system eliminates the need to manually operate the clutch lever while riding. This applies to all situations, from starting off and changing gears to demanding off-road maneuvers. BMW Motorrad is setting a new standard in this vehicle class.

A range of attractive options will be added at the time of market launch: The F 450 GS can be equipped with an Akrapovic end muffler and original BMW Motorrad cross-spoke wheels on request. The result is a package that combines sporty dynamic performance, technical innovation and GS DNA perfectly.

Performance developed from scratch: A confident companion for both road and off-road riding. The completely redesigned BMW F 450 GS is a sporty adventure bike that complements the current BMW Motorrad model portfolio, with developers focusing on excellent handling characteristics, strong performance, durability, and optimum accessibility.

The design focuses on the consistent implementation of the current GS design language. With iconic features such as the LED headlight with "X" daytime riding light and the distinctive flyline, the bike's affiliation with the BMW Motorrad GS family is clear at first glance.

Completely redesigned, smooth-running and characterful two-cylinder in-line engine with 135-degree crankpin offset for dynamic riding pleasure on asphalt and off-road. At the heart of the new BMW F 450 GS is a completely newly developed two-cylinder in-line engine with fuel injection and a stainless steel exhaust system on the right-hand side. The new F 450 GS impresses with its powerful performance and pulling power, delivering a power output of 35 kW (48 hp) at 8,750 rpm and a maximum torque of 43 Nm at 6,750 rpm. Thanks to the use of high-tech materials and optimized internal friction, these performance values are achieved with exactly 420 cm³. This makes the engine one of the most compact and powerful in the A2 two-cylinder segment. It not only meets the strict EU5+ requirements but is also particularly economical, consuming just 3.8 liters per 100 km. A range of over 350 km can be achieved in conjunction with the 14-liter tank. The maintenance interval is the standard 10,000 km for BMW motorcycles.

Unique on the motorcycle market, the engine features a crankshaft with crankpins offset by 135 degrees and, in conjunction with a single balance shaft, sets a technical exclamation mark: this design ensures a characterful, emotional ride while simultaneously reducing unwanted vibrations to an exceptionally low level.

Easy Ride Clutch (ERC) for a significant increase in dynamics, operating comfort, and riding comfort. A technical highlight of the new BMW F 450 GS is the Easy Ride Clutch (ERC). Its core is a precision centrifugal unit in the clutch, which engages the clutch depending on engine speed.

This system is standard on the GS Trophy variant and available as an optional accessory for all other model variants. In combination with the Shift Assistant Pro, manual operation of the clutch lever is completely eliminated – from starting off and gear changes to demanding maneuvers.

The clutch lever, however, remains intact and allows the rider to intervene manually at any time if necessary – for example, to lift the front wheel over an obstacle or to improve control when descending on slippery surfaces.

Technologically, the ERC is based on an advanced centrifugal clutch. Unlike conventional systems, it remains closed during overrun. This creates natural, familiar, and predictable handling at all times – comparable to a conventional clutch. The engine brake remains fully active until just before a stop; only when the idle speed is reached does the ERC automatically open, reliably preventing the engine from stalling.

The system ensures greater dynamics, control, and comfort – whether maneuvering, in city traffic, on winding roads, or off-road.

Six-speed transmission and left-mounted secondary drive. Shift Assistant Pro for quick upshifts and downshifts without clutch operation. The likewise newly designed six-speed transmission transmits torque to the left-hand secondary drive via an X-ring chain. For fast upshifts and downshifts without clutch operation, the new F 450 GS is offered with Shift Assistant Pro in all equipment variants except the basic variant. This can be retrofitted to the basic version.

"Rain," "Road," and "Enduro" riding modes, as well as ABS Pro, DBC, DTC, and MSR (engine drag control), are standard features for a high level of riding enjoyment and safety. An additional "Enduro Pro" riding mode is available starting with the Exclusive trim variant. The BMW F 450 GS offers three riding modes as standard: "Rain", "Road" and "Enduro", allowing the motorcycle to be adapted to suit individual preferences. Standard equipment also includes ABS Pro, Dynamic Brake Control (DBC), Dynamic Traction Control (DTC) and engine drag torque control (MSR).

The additional “Enduro Pro” mode, which is used from the Exclusive equipment variant onwards, is designed for off-road use with coarse-tread off-road tires and allows the ABS on the rear wheel to be deactivated.

Newly developed chassis with tubular steel frame for optimal rigidity, robustness, and driving precision. Short wheelbase for agile and playful handling. The new BMW F 450 GS also features a completely new chassis concept. Playful handling, optimum accessibility, high riding precision and riding stability were the developers' top priorities. The specially developed lattice-tube frame of the BMW F 450 GS consists of welded steel tubes and forged parts. The frame integrates the two-cylinder in-line engine as a supporting element and is designed to be lightweight yet robust.

The front wheel is guided via KYB upside-down telescopic forks, while the rear wheel is guided via an aluminum hollow cast double armed swinging arm with a KYB central spring strut featuring progressive damping. Front wheel control is provided by a torsionally rigid KYB upside-down telescopic fork with a 43 mm inner tube diameter. The Sport and GS Trophy variants feature the so-called "sports suspension." The fork is adjustable for rebound and compression damping. Rear wheel control is provided by a closed, and therefore extremely torsionally rigid, yet lightweight, hollow-cast aluminum double-sided swing arm, coupled with a directly connected KYB central spring strut (adjustable spring preload and rebound damping) with travel-dependent damping derived from rally racing, a unique feature in this segment.

Wheels and tires tailored to the typical BMW GS applications. The new BMW F 450 GS features lightweight yet robust cast aluminum wheels. It is fitted with tubeless tires for road and off-road use, sized 100/90-19 at the front and 130/80-17 at the rear. Additionally, the Original BMW Motorrad Accessories range offers cross-spoke wheels.

A powerful braking system combined with BMW Motorrad ABS Pro ensures safe braking even when leaning. Dynamic Brake Control (DBC) and Dynamic Brake Light are additional safety features. The front wheel of the new BMW F 450 GS features a floating single-disc brake with a [ADDRESS]-piston fixed caliper and a 310 mm brake disc diameter for superior, stable deceleration. A single disc brake with 1-piston floating caliper and 240 mm diameter is used on the rear wheel.

The new BMW F 450 GS already comes standard with BMW Motorrad ABS Pro. ABS Pro also offers increased safety when braking in curves by enabling ABS-assisted braking while leaning. Dynamic Brake Control (DBC) offers increased safety when braking, even in difficult situations, by preventing unintentional throttle application. The dynamic brake light effectively alerts following vehicles to the braking motorcycle ahead.

Optimal ergonomics and equipment for comfortable, playful, and agile motorcycling on and off-road. A sophisticated ergonomic triangle and a high, close-to-the-body handlebar made of tapered aluminum tubing ensure an ideal riding position in all conditions. The body and the 14-liter fuel tank below it are designed for optimal support and good knee contact, both when seated and while standing off-road. A wide range of accessories are available to meet the individual needs of riders, including a handlebar riser, a rally seat, and the option of a low seat.

Three different seat variants, adjustable hand levers, a handlebar riser, and secure footrests with height-adjustable gearshift and footbrake levers ensure optimal riding comfort both on and off-road. The new BMW F 450 GS comes with a two-part seat (845 mm) as standard. The low Black rider's seat (830 mm) and the high Rallye seat in Black/White/Red (865 mm), available as part of the Original BMW Motorrad Accessories, can be adapted to individual requirements. The standard adjustable handlebar levers and the optional 20 mm handlebar risers made of high-strength anodized silver aluminum offer further adjustment options.

The new BMW F 450 GS comes standard with a footrest system with removable rubber grips, whose serrated profile makes it suitable for off-road use. A very practical feature is the easy height adjustment of the foot brake lever by 20 mm in two positions to suit individual needs for on- and off-road riding. The gearshift lever is also height-adjustable.

Wider enduro footrests are included starting with the Exclusive version or are available as optional accessories.

High touring and everyday performance thanks to sophisticated vehicle and weather protection, as well as a comprehensive storage concept. The modular design of the available windshields (optional accessories) allows for individual customization. Depending on the intended use and personal preference, you can choose between the high Tour windshield (height-adjustable) and the clear or tinted Rally windshield. This allows the comfort and wind and weather protection of the new BMW F 450 GS to be tailored specifically to individual needs.

In the event of a fall or tip-over, Original BMW Motorrad Accessories offer effective ways to protect your motorcycle from damage, including engine guards, engine protection bars, front axle protectors, and other protective components.

The diverse range of special accessories – whether side bags, tail bags, luggage rolls, tank bags, luggage racks, or top cases – offers maximum flexibility for every application.

Powerful LED light units as standard. Connectivity featuring a large, perfectly readable 6.5-inch TFT display that provides comprehensive information and functionality. Practical USB-C socket in the cockpit area. The new BMW F 450 GS features an LED headlight with an iconic "X" daytime riding light signature as standard. The turn indicator and control lamps of the F 450 GS also use LED technology.

A large 6.5-inch TFT display is also standard on the new BMW F 450 GS. The variety of information, display quality, and, last but not least, user-friendliness are premium. It comes standard with screen displays tailored to the BMW GS world: the Pure Ride Screen and the Sport Screen with detailed information on DTC, braking force, and lean angle. Taking phone calls, listening to music, and navigation while riding is also possible.

Four attractive equipment variants for the new BMW F 450 GS. The new BMW F 450 GS is available in four equipment variants: the BMW F 450 GS Basis model in Cosmic Black and the BMW F 450 GS Exclusive , also in Cosmic Black, with off-road footrests, handguards, a plastic underbody guard, Riding Modes Pro, Shift Assistant Pro, and a clear windshield.

Another equipment variant is the BMW F 450 GS Sport in Racing Red, featuring off-road footrests, handguards, a plastic underbody protection, Riding Modes Pro, Shift Assistant Pro, a clear windshield, and the “sports suspension” (with KYB fork adjustable in rebound and compression). The fourth variant, the BMW F 450 GS Trophy in Racing Blue Metallic, tops the lineup. It features off-road footrests, white handguards, Riding Modes Pro, Shift Assistant Pro, “Sports Suspension”, a tinted rally windshield, an aluminum engine guard, and the new, enhanced version of centrifugal clutch: the Easy Ride Clutch (ERC).

The highlights of the new BMW F 450 GS: • Development focus: excellent handling characteristics, strong performance, durability, and optimal accessibility.

Sebring. The anniversary weekend in #Sebring (USA), celebrating the 50 th birthday of #BMW of North America , brought both highlights and setbacks for BMW M Motorsport. [ADDRESS] rd edition of the famous Twelve Hours of #Sebring marked the second round of the #IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship (IWSC). As at the season opener in Daytona (USA), Dries Vanthoor (BEL) in the #24 BMW M Hybrid V8 of the BMW M Team RLL secured the pole position. In the race itself, the #24 fell far back due to an unavoidable collision. The #25 sister car finished fifth. The new BMW #M4 GT3 EVO celebrated a double podium in the GTD PRO class, with the two Paul Miller Racing cars taking second and third places. Additionally, there was a first victory for the new BMW M4 GT4 EVO in Sebring .

From P10 on the grid, Sheldon van der Linde (RSA), Marco Wittmann (GER), and Robin Frijns (NED) in the #25 BMW M Hybrid V8 consistently moved forward. After a final yellow phase about 45 minutes before the end, Frijns was in sixth place and managed to gain one more position in the closing minutes.

In the pole car with number 24, Vanthoor, Philipp Eng (AUT), and Kevin Magnussen (DEN) started a comeback after a drive-through penalty and made their way back to the front of the field. However, about three hours before the end, there was a setback. The BMW M Hybrid V8 was hit on the right rear by another car after a pit stop. Magnussen initially returned to the track, but the car was so severely damaged that a lengthy repair was necessary. Only after more than an hour could the #24 crew rejoin the action and was classified twelfth in the GTP class.

The two BMW M Hybrid V8s of BMW M Team RLL have been sporting a special anniversary livery since this weekend in Sebring. [ADDRESS] years ago, on 15 th March 1975, BMW of North America was founded. A few days later, with the Sebring victory of the BMW 3.0 CSL, which was displayed over the weekend, came the first triumph of BMW Motorsport in North America. Jochen Neerpasch, co-founder and first CEO of BMW Motorsport GmbH, and Brian Redman (USA), Sebring winner of 1975, were also present at the anniversary weekend.

GTD PRO: Paul Miller Racing celebrates a double podium.

The BMW M4 GT3 EVO added two more podium places to its already impressive success series in its debut season. The two Paul Miller Racing cars took second and third places in the GTD PRO class. Dan Harper (GBR), Max Hesse (GER), and Jesse Krohn (FIN) narrowly edged out their teammates Madison Snow, Neil Verhagen, and Connor De Phillippi (all USA). In the GTD class, Turner Motorsport with the #96 BMW M4 GT3 EVO finished sixth.

First victory for the new BMW M4 GT4 EVO.

Already on Friday, a two-hour race of the IMSA Michelin Pilot Challenge was on the schedule in Sebring. The new BMW M4 GT4 EVO is also in its debut season, and the BMW M Motorsport teams made a big impression with the new customer racing car in Sebring. The team from CarBahn Racing w/ Peregrine Racing achieved the first victory for the BMW M4 GT4 EVO with drivers Sean McAlister and Jeff Westphal (both USA). Dillon Machavern and Francis Selldorff (both USA) also reached the podium with Turner Motorsport, finishing third. Just behind them, the BMW M4 GT4 EVO from Auto Technic Racing, driven by Austin Krainz (USA) and Steven McAleer (GBR), finished fourth.

Comments after the 12h Sebring:

Andreas Roos, Head of BMW M Motorsport: “The start into the Sebring weekend was very positive with the pole position by Dries Vanthoor. Unfortunately, the race itself in the GTP category was disappointing – we have to be honest. Car number 24 managed to fight back to the front after the initial penalty but was ultimately taken out of the race by an unsafe release by a competitor. After the accident, a lengthy repair was necessary, and all chances for a good result were taken away. Car number 25 also didn't have a completely error-free race. In the end, it managed to finish fifth, but that is obviously not what we had hoped for after the good performance of our BMW M Hybrid V8 in qualifying. However, we are now looking forward, as our cars were reliable and performed well. The double podium by Paul Miller Racing with the two BMW M4 GT3 EVOs in second and third places in the GTD PRO is definitely pleasing. It's a great result at the 12 Hours of Sebring, and I am very happy for the whole team and the drivers. Additionally, there was a first victory to celebrate in the IMSA Michelin Pilot Challenge race for the BMW M4 GT4 EVO. Congratulations to CarBahn Racing w/ Peregrine Racing and also to Turner Motorsport for the first podium with our new GT4.”

Marco Wittmann (#25 BMW M Hybrid V8, BMW M Team RLL, 5 th place): “It was a weekend of mixed feelings. On one hand, we were overjoyed after qualifying about the pole position for car number 24. This shows that we have a car that is extremely good in qualifying for one lap. Unfortunately, the race didn't go as well. It looked good for a while, we worked our way back to the front and were on course for a podium. But in the end, it was 'only' fifth place for car number 25. That's somewhat disappointing, as we were good in terms of speed, even though the Porsches were stronger in the end. Now, we need to make the car even faster in the race. It's a bit of a shame because we all had higher hopes after qualifying and thought we might make it to the podium. So the conclusion is that we drivers remained error-free and ended up in fifth place.”

Philipp Eng (#24 BMW M Hybrid V8, BMW M Team RLL, 12 th place): “Our weekend started perfectly. Our car had a very good balance from the beginning, and Dries' qualifying was again great. We were also doing well in the race after a yellow phase that came at the right time. Then, unfortunately, a competitor took us out in the pit lane. That's extremely disappointing. We had a bad day today, but we also showed with both cars that we are fast and reliable. I am sure that better days will come soon.“

Dan Harper (#48 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paul Miller Racing, 2 nd place GTD PRO): “P2 for us and P3 for our sister car here in Sebring – a great result for the team. We can be delighted with the results as we also scored important points at the four and eight-hour marks for the Endurance Cup. After our bad luck in Daytona we were all a bit disappointed an knew that we need to get ourselves back up and running here. We achieved that. In the end, the winning Porsche was just a little bit too quick. Although we didn’t have a perfect race, we can be happy to spray some champagne.”

Neil Verhagen (#1 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paul Miller Racing, 3 rd place GTD PRO): “It's a great way to end the [ADDRESS] Hours. We feel like it’s a little bit of redemption to be on the podium here now as we think we should also have been up there in Daytona. Big thanks to all the guys at Paul Miller Racing for all the hard work that gave us the opportunity to make it onto the podium. We gave it our all und just fell a little bit short. We’ll try even harder next time.”

# BMW NA 50th Anniversary | 50 Stories for 50 Years [ADDRESS]: “Before BMW of North America: The Max Hoffman Era” Written by: Jackie Jouret
## If one character could be said to dominate BMW’s early years in the US, it’s Max Hoffman. As BMW’s sole distributor in this country from 1962 to 1975, Hoffman was a champion of the marque, one whose belief in BMW allowed cars like the 2002 to reach a broad audience of dedicated enthusiasts. Alas, Hoffman’s true role within BMW history is as much villain as hero, however, as it was with respect to nearly all of the marques represented at one time or another by the Hoffman Motors Corporation.

Woodcliff Lake, N.J.- [ADDRESS], 2025. ..If one character could be said to dominate BMW’s early years in the US, it’s Max Hoffman. As BMW’s sole distributor in this country from 1962 to 1975, Hoffman was a champion of the marque, one whose belief in BMW allowed cars like the 2002 to reach a broad audience of dedicated enthusiasts. Alas, Hoffman’s true role within BMW history is as much villain as hero, however, as it was with respect to nearly all of the marques represented at one time or another by the Hoffman Motors Corporation.

Hoffman’s story begins in Vienna, Austria, where he was born in 1904. His father inherited a general store that turned into a manufacturer of sewing machines and then bicycles, and Hoffman spent his young adulthood racing on two wheels and four. [ADDRESS], he quit racing and began importing British, German, French, and Italian cars to Austria, and exporting European cars to the Middle East. Hoffman did well, but in 1938, when the Nazi military marched into Austria he left for the relative safety of Paris. Two years later, the Nazis were closing in once again, and Hoffman—whose father was Jewish—boarded a steamer for New York.

Hoffman had intended to export American-made trucks to Egypt, but when that fell through, he began making metallized plastic jewelry instead. His designs proved popular in the wartime economy, and he used his windfall to return to the automotive business in 1947. Adopting the name Maximilian—his legal name remained Mark Edwin—and dropping the final “n” from his surname, he opened Hoffman Motors’ first showroom at 487 Park Avenue, with a single Delahaye on the floor. Within a year, he’d be Jaguar’s official US importer, and he’d eventually represent 21 marques in the US. Hoffman encouraged them to build cars to suit American tastes and budgets, resulting in the Mercedes 300SL and 190SL, the Porsche Speedster, and the Alfa Romeo Giulietta Spyder, among others.

In 1954, Hoffman went to Munich, hoping to add BMW to his stable of marques. The company had begun producing cars again in 1951, and its new Oldsmobile-inspired V8 engine had been designed with the US in mind. Better still, BMW’s 501 and 502 sedans were soon to be joined by a V8-powered roadster, Grand Touring coupe and convertible, all of which were intended for export.

Hoffman was shown photos of the 528 roadster prototype, which he dismissed as so unattractive as to be sales-proof in the US. Back in New York, he decided to stage an intervention, asking German-born American designer Albrecht Graf von Goertz to produce a few sketches and send them to BMW. Thus began a relationship that would see Goertz design one of the most beautiful cars ever built, the 507 roadster, while substantially redesigning its 503 counterpart, as well.

Hoffman assured BMW that the 507, especially, would sell well in the US, and he promised to order 2,500 examples. That would certainly cover the model’s development cost, including the expensive revisions Hoffman had ordered, but that number was soon reduced to a “firm order of 1,000 cars,” then to 300 cars per year over four years. To make matters worse, Hoffman also reneged on his pre-payment commitments, even after those were reduced from $1 million to $500,000.

All of that contributed substantially to BMW’s 1959 brush with bankruptcy, which nearly saw the company absorbed into Mercedes until an investment by Herbert Quandt ensured its independence.

Making matters worse, the high retail price of these hand-built cars made them astronomically expensive by the time they reached the US. Each car retailed for nearly $10,000, as much as a far more powerful and luxurious Cadillac at the time. The demand for such an expensive BMW would be severely limited regardless of its style or performance, and Hoffman ended up importing a mere 16 507s throughout all of 1957 and ’58.

At the end of that year, BMW terminated its contract with Hoffman and gave exclusive distribution rights to Fred Oppenheimer’s Fadex Corporation, which had successfully imported the Isetta and other BMW microcars. BMW’s large cars were difficult to sell even for Oppenheimer, and in 1959 he asked to terminate the distribution agreement. At BMW’s request, Fadex held on for two more years, but sold just 1,212 BMWs during that period. In October 1961, the relationship with Fadex was finally dissolved, and BMW Automobile Parts, Inc. was set up in its place. A wholly-owned sales subsidiary seemed likely to follow, but none would materialize.

In the meantime, the 21 marques represented by Max Hoffman in the US had been reduced to just two: Lancia and Porsche, the latter only east of the Mississippi. Though he later claimed he’d given up the rest to focus on BMW, the manufacturers had severed their relationships with him one by one over the previous decade: Volkswagen in 1953, Jaguar in 1954, Mercedes in 1957, BMW in 1959, Fiat in 1960, and Alfa Romeo in 1961. Some did so because they deemed Hoffman a customer-service liability, others simply to cut out the middleman. In most cases, however, these brands (excluding BMW) dissolved their agreements with Hoffman at great expense, under terms that, in many cases, extracted hundreds of dollars for every car sold in the US until the original contracts expired.

That BMW would return to Hoffman’s embrace seems inexplicable, but the company lacked the funding to establish its own distribution network over the vast geography of the US. Hoffman had a strong advocate in Paul Hahnemann, recently arrived from Borgward to become BMW’s new board member for sales. Undoubtedly, the contract suited both men, even as BMW protected itself by contracting with Hoffman for just three years, from March 1962 through the end of 1964. The document required Hoffman to order 1,000 cars during that period, to deliver the “powerful service” for which he was little known, to take over BMW’s parts inventory, and to maintain distribution centers on both sides of the US.

Hoffman’s reinstatement coincided with the 1962 launch of the Neue Klasse, a reasonably priced midsize sedan that promised to succeed where the V8-powered cars had failed. [ADDRESS]-horsepower 1500 was underpowered for the American market, but the 90-horsepower 1800 fared slightly better, as did the 101-horsepower 2000 that arrived in 1966. Hoffman was always a fan of high-performance models, and in 1965 he imported 54 examples of the customer-racing 1800 TI/SA, more than one-quarter of total production.

A stronger product lineup helped BMW’s exports to the US increase from just 231 cars in 1963 to 1,253 in 1966, when the first examples of a new two-door started trickling in. Hoffman didn’t think the 1600-2 was likely to succeed in this market, and he doubted that it could be sold profitably. The car caught on anyway, helped by favorable reviews in magazines like Car and Driver and Road & Track . Later, clever advertising boosted sales further by emphasizing the car’s performance with copy that touted its “100-mph cruising speed, and phenomenal roadholding.”

The arrival of the 1600-2 saw BMW’s US exports jump from 1,253 cars in 1966 to 4,564 cars in 1967, and all but 168 were 1600-2s. When that car was joined by the more powerful 2002 in 1968, sales doubled yet again, to 9,172. The 2002 became a genuine sensation, inspiring enthusiasts to create the BMW Car Club of America in Boston and the BMW Automobile Club of America in Los Angeles.

Though Hoffman has been credited with the car’s creation, the 2002 was an organic development within BMW. In Munich, Hahnemann was pushing for a sporty compact car with “something extra” at the same time that BMW engineers were fitting the small two-door with BMW’s largest four-cylinder engine. [ADDRESS].0-liter engine allowed them to improve performance over the 1600-2’s 1.6-liter engine without exceeding US emissions limits, something that a higher state of tune couldn’t achieve. Hoffman had nothing to do with its development, though he certainly welcomed its arrival. He does, on the other hand, deserve credit for the Bavaria, a stripped-down version of BMW’s large sedan that sold for under $5,000 in the US. The car proved popular, but BMW itself lost money on every Bavaria while profitable cars like the 2800 and 3.0 CS sold in exceedingly small numbers. By 1971, BMW decided to stop offering its large cars in the US altogether after 1977.

As that suggests, Hoffman’s business practices were proving problematic for BMW. He expanded the dealer network considerably, but his low bar to entry—shops that Hoffman approved for a dealership could buy the necessary signage and equipment for as little as $1,500 and could order as few as two cars—meant that many dealers were unqualified to provide knowledgeable repairs or other services. Spare parts were lacking, as well. “Hoffman wasn’t very interested in what happened after he’d sold the cars,” said Chicago BMW dealer Bill Knauz. “He didn’t pay you properly on parts, service, warranty work, etc. When it came to Max’s pocket book, Max took care of Max.”

More concerning for BMW, Hoffman’s ordering practices were erratic, causing problems at the Munich factory. Sales fluctuated more than BMW could tolerate, and they weren’t increasing at a rate that the company expected given the marque’s increasing visibility among American enthusiasts. Hoffman wasn’t particularly interested in following BMW’s directives for expansion, however, as he was making more than enough profit as things stood—more than BMW, as it happened.

Those irregularities had gone largely unnoticed until the early 1970s, when new leadership arrived at BMW headquarters. When the new board members began taking a hard look at BMW’s sales and distribution strategies, Hoffman’s days were numbered. All that remained was to extricate BMW from Hoffman’s unusually lucrative and long-term contracts.

Class G Vanishing act: Gone but proudly not forgotten

Class H Style matters: Opulence meets Elegance before Times change forever

Prizes will also be awarded once again to spectacular concept cars from a variety of manufacturers competing in a separate class with a rich tradition.

The Concorso d’Eleganza parade on the terrace of Villa d’Este will take place in customary style on the Saturday of the event. Beyond the “Trofeo BMW Group - Best of Show” top prize, the participants and competing vehicles at the Concorso will each battle it out for victory in their individual categories, for the “Coppa d’Oro” prize awarded by Public Referendum and for an array of other distinctions such as the “Trofeo del Presidente”, which will be presented by Helmut Käs, Head of BMW Group Classic and President of the Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este. Star opera singer and BMW Group Classic brand ambassador Jonas Kaufmann will again present the “Trofeo Il Canto del Motore” for the best engine sound, as chosen by the Jury.

The Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este will provide the stage for spectacular BMW Group world premieres once more this year. The BMW brand will celebrate the premiere of an elegantly sporting one-off designed to provide motoring pleasure for two; BMW Motorrad will present a case study in unbridled adrenalin on two wheels; and BMW M GmbH will bring several high-performance models to Lake Como, including a world premiere.

The 2025 calendar contains a multitude of anniversaries that will be honoured in suitable style at the Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este. This will be the first time that all of the still-surviving original body variants of the BMW 328 that lined up for the 1940 Mille Miglia have come together to be displayed – so it is a truly unique occurrence. The cars include the victorious BMW 328 Touring Coupé and the legendary BMW 328 “Mille Miglia” [ADDRESS] roadster (nicknamed the “Trouser Crease Roadster”). BMW finished the race in 1st, 3rd, 5th and 6th places, and also won the prize for regularity and the team award in all classes.

BMW Group Classic will bring a number of cars from its collection to Cernobbio to help mark a handful of other anniversaries. One of the headline acts in the crowd-pulling grounds of Villa Erba will be an array of different BMW 3 Series models of all generations reflecting 50 years of the 3 Series. Meanwhile, a pair of BMW icons from the 1950s – the BMW 507 and 503 – notch up their 70th birthdays this year and will be integrated across the event programme in fitting style. Not to be forgotten and likewise on the Lake Como bill will be the BMW Isetta, itself turning 70 in 2025. The 50th anniversary of the legendary BMW Art Cars will be embodied by Sandro Chia’s Art Car no. 13 (a BMW M3 GTR). Rolls-Royce Motor Cars is also celebrating a special milestone, the centenary of the launch of the very first Phantom – the pinnacle model in the marque’s portfolio.

Broad Arrow Auctions – a Hagerty (NYSE: HGTY) company – is the official auction house partner of the Concorso d'Eleganza Villa d'Este. In this its first year in the role, it will auction a selection of extraordinary collectors’ vehicles. The auction will take place over two days in the grounds of Villa Erba. An independent auction focusing on BMW cars will be held on the evening of Saturday, 24 May. Among the examples in the sale will be a BMW 507 Series II from 1958, a 1981 BMW M1 and a BMW Z8 from model year 2000. The main auction – open to all brands – is scheduled for Sunday, 25 May. Consignors wanting to offer exceptional vehicles for auction at the Concorso d'Eleganza Villa d'Este are asked to contact a Broad Arrow Auctions specialist on [CONTACT_PHONE] (UK/Europe) or [CONTACT_PHONE] (North America), or via e-mail at [CONTACT_EMAIL] .

BMW Group Classic thanks its partners A. Lange & Söhne, Broad Arrow Auctions, VRANKEN-POMMERY MONOPOLE and Schedoni Luxury Goods SRL for their support.

Helmut Käs, Head of BMW Group Classic and President of the Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este:

“This year’s edition of the Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este is set to be another wonderful event featuring myriad highlights. The vehicles entered in the concours and their owners represent the focal points and centrepiece of the event. Awaiting us is an exciting competition for the coveted prizes, first and foremost the “Trofeo BMW Group – Best of Show”. But that’s not all: we have three world premieres from BMW to look forward to and will be celebrating several fantastic anniversaries. The special exhibition of all the surviving cars that raced to glorious overall victory for BMW in the 1940 Mille-Miglia is particularly close to my heart. Guests can experience this and much more – not only at Villa d’Este but also once again on the public days in the gardens of Villa Erba.”

Davide Bertilaccio, CEO Villa d'Este Hotels:

“The Concorso d'Eleganza has been part of the history and tradition of Villa d'Este for almost a century now, and we feel honoured to be able to welcome vehicle owners from around the world – together with cars of rare beauty and value – year in, year out.

# BMW Motorrad präsentiert die BMW R 1300 R „TITAN“.
## Ein kompromissloses Custom Bike mit BMW Motorrad Leidenschaft und Präzision bis ins letzte Detail.
Date: 2025-07-08 | Author: Tim Diehl-Thiele BMW Group | ID: T0451151EN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Munich. Passion for motorsports, design, and, of course, BMW Motorrad.

A small group of BMW Motorrad employees had the opportunity to bring this passion to life. As part of an extraordinary project, Philipp Ludwig served as project manager, vehicle designer Andreas Martin, Theresa Stukenbrock as colour and graphic designer, and prototype builders Paul Summerer and Thomas Becker, who brought their experience and passion to the project, worked together to create a unique vehicle.

The BMW R 1300 R "TITAN" - brute and aggressive, beautiful and extraordinary, fast and precise - built to win.

Its design incorporates the basic styling elements of the new BMW R 1300 R, translating them into the aggressive lines of a sprint racer.

The characteristic lines of the BMW R 1300 R tank and fairing are reflected in the monocoque typical of racing machines and the striking air duct panel of the standard machine continues the dynamics of the "TITAN" in an exaggerated sense.

Visually, the weight is pushed over the front wheel to keep it on the tarmac for as long as possible when starting off.

The motorcycle's overall proportions are compactly built around the centrepiece: the 1300cc boxer engine. It also resembles a predatory cat, patiently waiting to sprint off even when stationary.

In contrast to the forged carbon-fibre underneath, the striking graphic captures the impression of movement with a modern, clear interpretation complemented by metallic blue accents.

Akrapovic, a long-standing BMW Motorrad partner, assisted in developing the BMW R 1300 R "TITAN." This collaboration enabled the team to design a comprehensive titanium Akrapovic exhaust system that enhances the powerful character of this custom bike, both visually and acoustically. The exhaust runs out of the two cylinders, comes together briefly under the bike, and ends in a boxer-style, two-flow outlet under the towering, aggressively rising rear end.

The new BMW R 1300 R has a low profile on the tarmac, supported by a specially manufactured Wilbers chassis with a long swinging arm. This chassis is hard-tuned to ensure that no performance of the series-production engine is wasted.

An aggressive-looking nitrous oxide bottle sits between the two titanium rear silencers, injecting the injection system with nitrous oxide at the touch of a button. This propels the rider and machine toward the finish line with extra power.

Once the oxygen transporter arrives in the engine, the sheer power thrusts the tires into the tarmac via the transmission and shaft drive, catapulting the BMW R 1300 R "TITAN" forward.

The gears slot into place precisely and the Magura HC3 brake lever recaptures the released energy after the finish line, decelerating the bike to a stop.

The footrests extend far to the rear, providing Philipp with the necessary support during sprint races.

The BMW R 1300 R "TITAN" is a custom bike that embodies BMW Motorrad's passion and precision in every detail!

In der Vielfalt der Teilnehmenden, die aus Wirtschaft, Wissenschaft und von NGOs kommen, und deren leidenschaftlichen Engagement liegt für die BMW Group das Potenzial dieser internationalen Zusammenkunft.

Im Fokus stehen beim diesjährigen Summit, an dem die BMW Group mit über 50 Delegierten teilnimmt, die Themen Bildung, Kreislaufwirtschaft, verantwortungsvolle Technologien, Hassbekämpfung sowie Frieden und Sicherheit. Für noch mehr Impulse und vielseitige Perspektiven sind einflussreiche Persönlichkeiten aus Wirtschaft, Politik, Sport und Kultur zu Gast, darunter auch der einstige Kapitän der deutschen Fußball-Nationalmannschaft sowie Fußball-Weltmeister 2014 Philipp Lahm. Er ist Gesprächspartner von [EXECUTIVE_OFFICER] bei der Eröffnungszeremonie des Summits in der Olympiahalle am 3. November.

Bildung ist der Schlüssel

In einer Podiumsdiskussion während der vier Kongresstage wird sich [EXECUTIVE_OFFICER] der Frage widmen, wie verantwortungsvolles Leadership dazu beitragen kann, Vertrauen in Institutionen, Wissenschaft und Demokratie wieder zu stärken und welche Schlüsselrolle Bildung dabei spielt. Ihre Gesprächspartner sind seine Exzellenz Miguel Ángel Moratinos, Untergeneralsekretär der Vereinten Nationen und Hoher Repräsentant für die Allianz der Zivilisationen der Vereinten Nationen (UNAOC) sowie Gabriela de la Torre, verantwortlich für Begabtenförderung im mexikanischen Bildungsministerium und Generaldirektorin des Programms „Adopt a Talent“ (Programa Adopte un Talento, PAUTA), das die wissenschaftliche Karriere von Kindern und Jugendlichen in ganz Mexiko durch außerschulische Aktivitäten fördert.

Die BMW Group engagiert sich seit vielen Jahren bei Bildungsinitiativen an ihren Standorten, eine Million Kinder haben bereits davon profitiert. In einer langjährigen Kooperation mit den Vereinten Nationen (UNAOC) werden vor allem Graswurzel-Initiativen gefördert, die Kindern Kenntnisse unter anderem in den MINT-Fächern Mathematik, Informatik, Naturwissenschaften und Technik vermitteln. Es sind wichtige Grundlagen für Berufe in genau jenen Bereichen, die eine Teilhabe am globalen Wirtschaftswachstum ermöglichen.

Darüber hinaus lädt die BMW Group bei dem Summit die Delegierten zu einem interaktiven Workshop ein, der sich mit der Kreislaufwirtschaft beschäftigt. Teilnehmende erfahren, wie sich zirkuläre Prinzipien in Geschäftsideen integrieren lassen und wie auf diese Weise Ressourcen geschont und CO₂-Emissionen reduziert werden.

# (R) EVOLUTION OF ART: Start of the BMW Art Car World Tour in Vienna.
## +++ BMW Group Group Niederlassung Wien invited to the official opening of the BMW Art Car World Tour at the Museum of Applied Arts +++ BMW Vision Neue Klasse, BMW Vision Neue Klasse X and BMW Art Cars exhibited together as part of the “(R) EVOLUTION OF ART” event +++ Design accelerates change: “Innovation and creativity are inextricably linked” +++
Date: 2025-03-21 | Author: Thomas Girst BMW Group | ID: T0449048EN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vienna. On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the BMW Art Car Collection, the BMW Art Car World Tour is taking place on all five continents with numerous accompanying activities and kicks off in Europe and Asia. The official start of the world tour was celebrated yesterday as part of the “(R) EVOLUTION OF ART” event at the BMW Group Niederlassung Wien. A total of five BMW Art Cars will be shown in Vienna at the Museum of Applied Arts and at the SPARK Art Fair from [ADDRESS]-23: the cars by Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg, David Hockney and Jeff Koons. The latest and 20th BMW Art Car – the BMW M Hybrid V8 by renowned American painter Julie Mehretu – will embark on an Asian tour and be displayed at Art Basel in Hong Kong on [ADDRESS]-30.

“We are honored to be able to host the start of the BMW Art Car World Tour in Vienna,” says Dr. Josef Reiter, Managing Director of BMW Group Niederlassung Wien. “As the BMW Group in Austria, we see it as our responsibility to promote art and culture. The (R) EVOLUTION OF ART event is part of our commitment to provide creative impulses and inspire dialogue between artists, their works of art and audiences. We believe that innovation and creativity are inextricably linked — just as in the development of our cars. Art appeals to emotions — just like a BMW. The moment in which a vehicle triggers enthusiasm, wonder or wonder is comparable to experiencing an impressive work of art. Designers and engineers are working to create not only functionality, but also an emotional bond — whether through iconic shapes, an unmistakable driving experience or the combination of technology and aesthetics,” says Reiter.

Design accelerates change: The BMW Vision Neue Klasse X and BMW Vision Neue Klasse together in Vienna for the first time. As part of the event, an insight into the Neue Klasse vision vehicles was also given. With the Neue Klasse, the BMW Group is making the mobility of the future a reality as early as this year. Vehicle dynamics, drive, battery technology, operating concept, digitization: Each of these aspects has been significantly further developed and, as with design, has sometimes skipped over a generation.

With the BMW Vision Neue Klasse, the BMW Group is giving a glimpse of what the next generation of vehicles from the core BMW brand will look like. The vision vehicle shows the BMW brand's new design language, which will be reflected in many other models from the brand. The new design language is clear, elegant and timeless. The new, all-electric vehicle architecture offers new interior design options.

In the BMW Vision Neue Klasse X, the aesthetics, technology and philosophy of the Neue Klasse are transferred to the sports activity vehicle sector. The vision vehicle offers a glimpse of the BMW iX3, which will go into series production at the Debrecen plant (Hungary) in 2025.

Born from passion: a brief history of the BMW Art Car Collection. [ADDRESS] June 1975, the BMW 3.0 CSL designed by American sculptor Alexander Calder took to the track at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. The project was initially intended as a one-time collaboration between the artist and BMW. The audience cheered for the colourful racing car and children rejoiced. BMW decided this had to continue! It all began with the passion for art and motorsport of French auctioneer and racing driver Hervé Poulain. In 1975, Poulain found a visionary ally in Jochen Neerpasch, founder and Head of BMW Motorsport, for his plan to enter a BMW designed by an artist in the legendary Le Mans endurance race. Even though the first BMW Art Car retired from the race after seven hours, it became a true crowd favourite, laying the foundations for the collection.

The BMW Group's Cultural Engagement. With over 100 projects worldwide, the BMW Group's international cultural funding has been an essential part of corporate communication for almost 50 years. The BMW Group's long-term commitment focuses on contemporary art, music and film, and design.

In addition to its own formats, such as the BMW Art Cars, and the “Opera for All” concerts, the company supports leading museums and art fairs as well as orchestras and opera houses around the world. BMW Group's commitment to culture is always based on mutual curiosity and appreciation. Despite all its cultural commitments, the company takes absolute freedom of creative potential for granted — because it guarantees groundbreaking works in art just as much as it is for innovations in a commercial enterprise. The BMW Group in Austria is involved in various cultural projects in Austria and has maintained a long-standing partnership with the Albertina Art Museum. In the area of contemporary art, BMW in Austria accompanies the music festival in Steyr and the Lido Sounds in Linz.

# BMW NA 50th Anniversary | 50 Stories for 50 Years [ADDRESS]: “Preserving the Past for The Future: Saving The Products That Established BMW Group’s Brand Identities in the USA.”
## The life cycle of an automobile has three distinct phases. First, it’s new, exciting, and perhaps expensive. A decade later, it’s out of date, with little value or allure unless it survives to the third phase. At this point, the automobile becomes ‘vintage’, and values rise once again as it becomes a treasured survivor. This is true of many BMW models, and it is especially true of race cars, which lose most of their value the moment they’re no longer competitive.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The life cycle of an automobile has three distinct phases. First, it’s new, exciting, and perhaps expensive. A decade later, it’s out of date, with little value or allure unless it survives to the third phase. At this point, the automobile

becomes ‘vintage’, and values rise once again as it becomes a treasured survivor. This is true of many BMW models, and it is especially true of race cars, which lose most of their value the moment they’re no longer competitive.

Racing has always been essential to BMW of North America’s marketing program, and its factory team had a race-winning history in IMSA going back to 1975 and the 3.0 CSL. Its CSLs were turned over to Peter Gregg for the following season, and the subsequent 320i Turbo, M1 IMSA [ADDRESS], and March prototypes—including the M1/C, one of the first cars with ground effects bodywork—were put in storage once their racing days were done.

In 1985, those groundbreaking race cars were on the verge of being destroyed forever when BMW NA’s newly-hired Motorsport Manager Erik Wensberg received some surprising news. “I can recall the very day, because I’d only been with the company for about three months,” said Wensberg. “I was at Lime Rock and was told that our race team, DM Engineering, had a bunch of our stuff gathering dust in a barn next to their shop in Danbury, Connecticut. I had no idea what they were talking about, but I said I’d come up and see.

“I opened the door of this barn, turned on the single light bulb hanging in the middle, and I was stunned. There’s the 320i Turbo with no wheels, sitting on the dirt floor. There’s the March M1/C, on its side. Two M1s, and a bunch of other stuff, wheels and boxes everywhere.”

Wensberg was told that BMW was going to donate the entire lot to a trade school “so that kids could learn to drill and cut. I said, ‘The hell it will! You lock this door and don’t open it until I tell you.’” He returned to Woodcliff Lake and found Hans Riedel, BMW’s Vice-President of Marketing. “I said, ‘Hans, this is a crime. All of our racing DNA is sitting in a pile of dirt in Connecticut, and they’re going to give it all away. We’ve got to restore these cars, bring them out, and show them as elements of pride in our history.’”

Crucially, Wensberg also expanded the collection, trading a spare M1 to Richard Conway in exchange for CSL #2275985—the car driven by Sam Posey and Brian Redman to second place at Riverside in 1975, to second and third with Stuck at the Lime Rock doubleheader, and second with Posey at Mid-Ohio.

All of the cars had been raced hard and put away wet, so to speak, and all were in need of restoration. With no budget for that purpose, Wensberg and Riedel got creative. “Riedel would bring me into every planning meeting where we were talking about a new production car and he’d say, ‘Erik, I think we need a vintage car here! What should we do?’ And I’d say, ‘Well, we could put the CSL there, but I need $45,000 to [have Jack Deren] restore it.’ ‘Okay, give Erik $45,000!’ We restored five or six cars one after another, and displayed them to great acclaim. We did a whole campaign with the enthusiast books, talking about a commitment to performance that dates back decades rather than months.

[ADDRESS] Turbo and the March M1/C and GTP (86G) prototypes had raced with turbocharged M12/13 engines that were problematic and expensive to keep running. Although they are all “display-only” now, Erik was able to restore the 320i Turbo and the BMW GTP as running examples. In 1992, they appeared at BMW Motorsport’s 20th-anniversary celebration, organized by Conway at Moroso Raceway in Florida. Four years later, they had a star turn when BMW was the featured marque at the Monterey Historic Races, an even bigger gathering in California.

Wensberg left BMW NA in February 1998, and his replacement was equally keen to maintain and expand the collection. Two years earlier, Larry Koch had helped Wensberg organize BMW’s presence at Monterey, and his first act as Motorsport Manager was to purchase a BMW 2002 race car from Vasek Polak’s shop in Los Angeles, which was being liquidated following Polak’s death. Later, he’d buy both of the E34 M5s campaigned by Ed Arnold Racing, including the one raced by David Donohue to the 1994 IMSA Supercar championship.

“The goal was to promote BMW performance and the M brand, and to show goodwill towards the BMW Car Club of America and various charities,” Koch said. “I added passenger seats to as many race cars as possible so we could provide rides, and I also started running the cars each year at the Monterey Historics, Lime Rock, and other vintage races, with the driver who drove the car when new if possible. We even took the March 86G and CSL to Goodwood, with Marc Surer and (then BMW NA CEO) Tom Purves driving in 2002 and 2003. It was all great fun, not ridiculously expensive, and it gained a lot of good press.”

From the mid-1980s through 2020, BMW NA began retaining its factory race cars, which has certainly helped to preserve the cars within the collection. Over the last two decades, BMW NA has retained at least one example of each body style raced by Prototype Technology Group in the American Le Mans Series from 1995-2006. That includes the most highly-developed E36 M3 that won Daytona in 1997 and Sebring in 1998, and two E46 M3 GTR race cars, one of which has been restored to its 2001 specification complete with its exotic P60 V8 engine as well as the Stars and Stripes livery in which it won Petit Le Mans in October 2001; the other runs the six-cylinder engine with which it won the Grand Am championship in 2004.

The most spectacular car of the era is the Sebring-winning 1999 V12 LMR, and the most unusual is one of a pair of 2006 335d race cars that competed in the 25 Hours of Thunderhill to promote BMW Clean Diesel. Driven by Car & Driver staffers, the cars used superior fuel economy to finish fourth.

At the end of the 2006 season, BMW NA took a hiatus from racing—officially, for lack of an appropriate venue in which to race its M3s, though Koch says the move had a financial motivation, as well. “The value of the dollar dropped a lot [against the Euro that had replaced the Deutschmark in 2000] between 2006 and 2008, impacting BMW NA’s profit margins,” he said. “Budgets were cut even before the economy crashed in late 2008, which is why the motorsport program was cancelled for 2007 and 2008.”

With no racing program to oversee, Koch shifted his attention to production cars as part of his role as BMW NA’s Mobile Tradition/Classic Manager. He acquired one of each generation of 3 Series for BMW, as well as an E28 M5 and Alpina V8 Roadster. “After the 1996 BMW celebration at Monterey, I wrote a paper that basically said we should use BMW’s heritage to promote the brand, and to differentiate BMW from the Lexus/Infiniti/Acura brands that had no heritage,” Koch said. “A subsequent consumer survey showed that brand heritage was the third most important factor in BMW purchases at that time, so we embarked on a heritage campaign—you’ll notice references to it in the TV ads of the time. It was also very popular with the BMW CCA, whose members were great extensions of the brand.”

In 2007, BMW NA began a new partnership with Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing, which handled the vintage cars until BMW returned to the ALMS in 2009. Developed in the wake of BMW’s withdrawal from Formula One, the E92 M3 GT was a showcase for aerodynamic and drivetrain developments.

When Koch retired in 2012, responsibility for BMW Group heritage worldwide had shifted to the Corporate Communications area of the company, so it made perfect sense for the BMW NA classic collection to be transferred to Tom Plucinsky, then Head of BMW Group Product Communications. “For me, it’s an honor and a privilege to be able to curate and preserve the heritage of BMW NA through the classic collection,” Plucinsky said.

“When I took over in late 2012 the E92 M3 GT racing program was just ending, and I inherited all the assets,” he continued. “We finished the 2012 season with two good cars, but unfortunately the chassis with the most provenance (#1101) had been crashed mid-season, and once the tub was repaired, it had remained as the spare chassis. My first order of business was restoring #1101 back to its 2012 Sebring-winning specification and livery. I also had to negotiate with BMW Motorsport to keep a couple of sets of the proprietary aerodynamic wheels that were used for the long races.”

Chassis #1101 with drivers Joey Hand and Dirk Müller won the ALMS titles for drivers, team, manufacturers, and Michelin Green-X Challenge in 2011, making it an especially important car within the collection.

“My second task was to rebuild #901, which was the very first M3 GT2 built and the 2009 Team and Manufacturers Championship-winning car,” Plucinsky said. “Again, both Team Principal, Bobby Rahal and BMW Motorsport were very supportive, finding the early parts and devoting the time needed to restore that car.”

For 2013, BMW NA and BMW Motorsport switched to the Z4 GTLM for IMSA racing in the US. In total, five examples of the Z4 GTLM were produced, of which the BMW NA collection holds four and BMW AG holds the fifth.

BMW NA also kept all four of the M6 GTLMs raced in 2016-2017, including the priceless John Baldessari Art Car (#1502) and the #1705 in “Bill Power” livery that took a GTLM-class victory in the 2017 Petit Le Mans, Bill Auberlen’s last race as a full-time BMW NA factory driver. The latter car is preserved as it took the checkered flag, complete with all of the dirt and debris it accumulated over ten hours at Road Atlanta.

In 2018, the M6 was replaced by the spectacular F92 M8 GTE, of which BMW intends to keep the cars that won Daytona (#1706) and Laguna Seca (#1802) in 2019 as well as a show car (#1705); the other three will eventually be sold. As BMW M Motorsport’s customer racing program has developed worldwide and race car engineering and parts support is available, BMW M Motorsport determined that it would be able to sell and provide support for the BMW M8 GTE. As a result, the 2020 Daytona winner has been sold to a private collector, and two others are ready to be sold for classic racing.

That’s a sizable collection of race cars, and maintaining it represents a substantial investment on the part of BMW NA. Since 2024, responsibility for the collection has been delegated to a new department: BMW Group Classic USA, led by Plucinsky.

Like Koch and Wensberg, Plucinsky ensures that the cars show off BMW’s heritage at concours events like Amelia Island, Legends of the Autobahn, and Pebble Beach. He’s also loaned them out for exhibits like Heroes of Bavaria and The Power of M at BMW CCA Foundation’s Ultimate Driving Museum, and to the Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles. Along with static events, some of the cars like the ALPINA 2002—now restored in its original Alpina orange livery—and the CSL get to race at the Rolex Monterey Motorsports Reunion.

Along with that impressive fleet of race cars, BMW Classic USA maintains a fleet of roadgoing BMWs collected initially by Koch and Kenn Sparks, each of whom preserved BMW’s road cars for different purposes.

While Koch was collecting cars like the 2002 tii, E28 M5, Alpina V8 Roadster, and every generation of 3 Series, Sparks was ensuring that BMW Manufacturing preserved its own history in Spartanburg. As part of his job directing internal communications for the plant, Sparks became responsible for the Zentrum, the plant’s welcome center and history museum. “At the time, BMW Mobile Tradition was just getting underway, and BMW chairman Bernd Pischetsrieder instructed Christian Eich to give the Zentrum a selection of BMWs that would show off the history of the company,” Sparks said. “We also built our own historical exhibit with the models being assembled at the plant, like very first 318i ‘signature car’ and the James Bond Z3 from GoldenEye .”

Sparks preserved a coterie of interesting Z-cars assembled at Spartanburg, including the last Z3 M roadster built, a Z3 M coupe in rare Laguna Seca Blue, and an export-only Z4 Alpina Roadster S. He saved plenty of X-vehicles, too, including an X5 with American flag paintwork done as part of the BMW STEP program for body and paint students that has served as a powerful symbol of BMW’s engagement with the US.

Finally, the collection includes several classic Minis, a few BMW Group era MINIs, a number of motorcycles and some additional artifacts such as design models. The motorcycles include several from the Butler & Smith era (1954-1980) acquired by Fred Jakobs of BMW Group Classic for display at the Zentrum. Many of the bikes were featured in the BMW CCA Foundation’s 2023 exhibit, BMW Motorcycles: A Century of Innovation.

Now that all the individual collections have been brought together under BMW Group Classic USA, the division can take a more strategic view of what should be added to the collection. “Koch and Sparks had done a great job of acquiring vehicles that would be important to the histories of BMW NA and Plant Spartanburg,” Plucinsky said. “Now it’s my job to fill in some missing vehicles and to plan for the addition of current vehicles that will tell the story of the company’s history 10, 20, 50 years from now.”

As a case in point, last year Plucinsky was able to purchase a V10 powered E60 M5 with a manual transmission—a combination that was only available in North America. More recently, BMW Group Classic USA added the five millionth and six millionth vehicles assembled at Plant Spartanburg: an X5 M in Toronto Red and an X6 M in Java Green, respectively. “We chose the models because of the 5M and 6M right in the names, and we chose them in those colors because wanted to memorialize that the plant can now paint BMW Individual colors,” Plucinsky said.

In May 2025, the plant’s seven millionth vehicle was added to the collection. This time it was an ALPINA XB7 in ALPINA Green, marking the end of the independent ALPINA era and the beginning of a new BMW ALPINA era next year.

“Today, the vehicles in the collection are used for a variety of communications initiatives,” Plucinsky said. “For example, last year was the launch of the new BMW M5 and M5 Touring, so examples of previous-generation M5s were in high demand for marketing and PR communications and events. This year is the 50 th Anniversary of the BMW 3 Series, so both the street and racing versions of these cars are in high demand. Finally, for my favorite classic activation this year, BMW NA celebrated the grand opening of its new headquarters on its 50 th Anniversary, and what better way to cut the ribbon than with the model that started it all for BMW in North America: the BMW 2002tii!”

+++ Vietnam prevails at Alpine Golf Club +++ Special guest Colin Montgomerie presents the trophies +++ More than 100 “Eagles for Education” during the tournament: BMW Group supports UNICEF and the joint education initiative "BRIDGE" with 116,000 euros +++

Bangkok. At the end of an unforgettable week at the BMW Golf Cup World Final in Bangkok (Thailand), there were only beaming faces to be seen at the concluding gala dinner. Among the winners of the largest international tournament series for amateur golfers were special guests Colin Montgomerie (SCO) and Fanny Sunesson (SWE), and all finalists from 38 countries and regions who had the privilege to enjoy this ‘once-in-a-lifetime’ experience – and contributed to a record result. The representatives of UNICEF Thailand also had every reason to smile. A remarkable number of 116 net eagles were recorded during the tournament. This means that the BMW Group, just during the World Final, supports the UN agency for children, UNICEF*, with 116,000 euros, helping to provide education to young people and thus enabling them to lead self-determined lives.

“It was our great pleasure to welcome golf enthusiasts from all over the world to Thailand and the beautiful capital of Bangkok. At the end of an unforgettable week, it is time to acknowledge the performance of Team Vietnam and the individual winners. Congratulations on the BMW Golf Cup World Final titles,” said Rene Gerhard, President and CEO, BMW Group Thailand. “Competitions need winners, but there is so much more to the World Final. A palpable sense of community that has developed across all the cultures and nationalities, the shared joy of golf and the delight generated by such a fantastic event will be remembered forever. Last but not least, the 116,000 euro to UNICEF and our joint initiative ‘BRIDGE’ will help to growth educational equality and therefore prosperity and social stability here in Thailand.”

The sporting part of the World Final, held for the first time in Thailand's capital, Bangkok, took place at the spectacular Alpine Golf Club and consisted of three rounds in three individual categories: [ADDRESS] (up to HCP 12), [ADDRESS] (HCP 13-28), and Ladies (HCP up to 28). Additionally, a National Team Category was compiled from the individual results. Team Vietnam emerged victorious with 302 net points, ahead of teams from China (297) and Japan (291). In the Ladies category, the title also went to Vietnam which Thi Quynh Nhu Nguyen (100) won ahead of Daniela Antillon Goñi (MEX, 97) and Akiko Wakamatsu (JPN, 96). The Chinese players Yong Zhang (104) and Lei Shi (101) celebrated a 1-2 result in the [ADDRESS] category, followed by Quang Duong Ta (101) from Vietnam. In the [ADDRESS] category, Suet Lung Leung (HKG, 105) triumphed ahead of Hamza Chraibi (MAR, 104) and Kyle Justin Tan (PHI, 104).

The trophies were presented to the winners at the concluding gala dinner by Scottish golf and Ryder Cup legend Colin Montgomerie. “I am very grateful to having been part of the BMW Golf Cup World Final. BMW golf events are second to none and I always enjoy them a lot,” said Montgomerie. “The World Final is like no other and gives the participants the very same treatment of a professional top event, a truly unique experience. Most of all, I wholeheartedly love to see that this event celebrates the best in our beautiful game: competitiveness and ambition, but also respect for one another, and sharing of joyful moments across cultural and national boundaries.”

In addition to experiencing the many attractions of Bangkok and the rich Thai culture, these moments included exclusive evening events and another special guest as Sweden’s Fanny Sunesson accompanied the World Final from the first to the last day. She not only charmed the players and guests with her warm personality but also shared her extensive experience as a former caddie for some of the world's best golfers, such as Sir Nick Faldo (ENG) and Adam Scott (AUS).

“Eagles for Education” is the slogan of the BMW Group’s educational initiative in golf. The company makes use of numerous BMW title tournaments around the world to fulfil its responsibility as a corporate citizen and to participate in solutions to social challenges. For the second time since 2024, this happened at the World Final through the support of the cooperation between the BMW Group and UNICEF, which is named “BRIDGE. Educating young people for tomorrow, today." The focus of the partnership is to bridge learning gaps within society and create learning and education opportunities in science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) – because STEM professions are particularly important given that they are the engine of global economic growth.

The list of countries where the BMW Group and UNICEF are working together includes South Africa (venue for the BMW Golf Cup World Final last year), Brazil, India, Mexico and Thailand, the host country for this year’s BMW Golf Cup World Final – all countries which have BMW Group presence.

# Hydrogen high tech at the BMW Group: start of series production in 2028 is getting closer.
## +++ First prototypes of the fuel cell system +++ Competence centres for hydrogen in Munich and Steyr +++ BMW Group Plant Steyr to manufacture third-generation fuel cell systems +++ Landshut technology hub will also supply components +++
Date: 2025-09-02 | Author: Lisa Aigner BMW Group | ID: T0452048EN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Munich. BMW Group Plant Steyr is getting ready for series production of fuel cell systems. The third generation of the BMW Group’s hydrogen drive system will be manufactured in Steyr from 2028, and the company’s competence centres in Munich and Steyr are already building the first prototypes. Further drive system components will come from the technology hub in Landshut.

“The launch of the first-ever fuel cell production model from BMW in 2028 will add another exceptionally efficient high-performance drive system with zero emissions to our technology-open product portfolio,” says Joachim Post, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Development . “The choice of Steyr as the production location clearly demonstrates our commitment to a European innovation footprint. The BMW competence centres in Munich and Steyr have a key role to play in the development of pioneering fuel cell systems.”

The third-generation BMW fuel cell system: more compact, more powerful, more efficient

The first generation of the fuel cell drive system was supplied entirely by the Toyota Motor Corporation (Toyota) and was fitted in the BMW 535iA back in 2014. The second generation made its debut in the current BMW iX5 Hydrogen pilot fleet. This time, BMW developed the overall fuel cell system itself, while the individual fuel cells came from Toyota.

For the new generation, the BMW Group and the Toyota Motor Corporation jointly develop the powertrain system for passenger vehicles, with the core fuel cell technology creating synergies for both commercial and passenger vehicle applications. This close collaboration enables both companies to leverage synergies in development and procurement while creating brand-specific models.

The third generation of fuel cell technology brings some major improvements:

Technological expertise at the BMW Group in Munich

The BMW Group is making prototypes of the highly efficient fuel cell systems at the company’s competence centre for hydrogen in Munich. An electrochemical reaction takes place in the fuel cell, which involves hydrogen from the tanks reacting with oxygen from the air. This reaction produces electricity that powers the electric motor and thereby supplies the vehicle with energy.

The fuel cell system comprises not only the fuel cells themselves, but also all the components and systems needed for their efficient operation. These include the cooling system and hydrogen- and air subsystems. The compact layout ensures the entire drivetrain delivers the levels of performance and safety for which BMW is renowned.

Prototype production is currently focused on development and validation of the assembly and testing processes, with particular attention paid to industrialisation, quality assurance and scalability in the longer term. In parallel to this, the prototypes are being used to develop operating strategy and for validation on both a system and vehicle level. These steps are crucial in preparing fuel cell technology for series production.

Series production at BMW Group Plant Steyr

Production of the fuel cell systems is due to get underway in 2028 at BMW Group Plant Steyr, which can call on decades of development and production expertise covering all drive system types across the BMW Group model range. New test rigs and production facilities are now being built and buildings modified to incorporate the new drive technology and constantly refine it.

“We are proud to be producing another innovative drive technology at Plant Steyr in future alongside the latest generation of electric motors and combustion engines,” says Klaus von Moltke, Senior Vice President Engine Production at BMW AG and Director of BMW Group Plant Steyr. “This, together with the development expertise we have available on-site, makes our plant a prime example of the BMW Group’s technology-open approach.”

Component manufacture at BMW Group Plant Landshut

BMW Group Plant Landshut is responsible for manufacturing key components for the fuel cell vehicles. Construction of new hardware and equipment for series production of the hydrogen-specific BMW Energy Master will start there in late May 2026. The BMW Energy Master controls the supply of power in the vehicle across a range from 400 – 800V. It also acts as the interface for data from the high-voltage battery. This control unit is supplemented by various components that are specifically required for the fuel cell application. Production of the first prototypes of the hydrogen-specific Energy Master will begin in mid-2026 just a few miles away at BMW Group Plant Dingolfing, where the prototypes of the BMW Energy Master for the Neue Klasse models were also made.

As with the BMW iX5 Hydrogen pilot fleet, Plant Landshut will once again manufacture the housing and pressure plate for the next model generation.

“At Rolls-Royce, we’re committed to being a good neighbour and having a positive impact on our local community. As the largest local employer, we inevitably have an impact on local traffic volumes, so we are especially keen to be involved in initiatives that support road safety and improved driver behaviour. We were therefore delighted to be able to support Westhampnett Parish Council by funding two new Speed Indicator Devices at key locations. The Speed Indicator Devices will make a lasting contribution to the safety and wellbeing of residents and our workforce alike.” Andrew Ball, Head of Corporate Relations, Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Rolls-Royce Motor Cars was delighted to contribute to a local community project to install two new Speed Indicator Devices at key locations on roads in the neighbouring village of Westhampnett and the attached hamlet of Maudlin. The Speed Indicator Devices, which are operated by Westhampnett Parish Council, are solar powered and display a ‘happy’ face if an approaching vehicle is below the speed limit, and a ‘sad’ face to those travelling at excessive speed. Unlike speed cameras, their purpose is educational and preventative, encouraging safer driving behaviour by making drivers more aware of their speed, especially in sensitive areas close to schools and in residential streets.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Munich. Success is teamwork – this applies to the BMW Group in close collaboration with its external partners as much as it does to successful athletes. Continuous training, constant optimisation and the will to develop are essential in both worlds. With the Partner Academy, the BMW Group is focusing precisely on that. Qualifications and further education are the keys to achieving top performances together with its partners and suppliers, and to securing long-term success.

Superbike world champion and BMW Motorrad factory rider Toprak Razgatlioglu knows that continuous development and collaboration take quality to the next level. He has benefitted from targeted training and a strong team on his way to the top of his sport, while the BMW Group also relies on perfect collaboration with excellent partners.

Toprak Razgatlioglu: The world title – a joint project

”Everything is teamwork,” Razgatlioglu explained when asked about the secret of his success in the 2024 FIM Superbike World Championship. “Working hard on the racetrack every day is not enough to win, but if your team is working hard every day, this is the perfect package. Only then can we make it to the top, as a unit.”

This principle also applies to the BMW Group and its global supplier network. With the Partner Academy, the company specifically promotes qualifications among its suppliers to jointly ensure high quality standards and drive innovation forward.

Partner Academy: Top performances through qualifications The Partner Academy is the central qualifications platform for worldwide suppliers and partners of the BMW Group. It offers BMW-specific training to ensure the highest standards and meet the growing demands of a dynamic market.

[EXECUTIVE_OFFICER], Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Human Resources and Real Estate , emphasised: “A common understanding is crucial for successful collaboration between us and our partners. Our Partner Academy is more than a platform – it provides our partners with the knowledge, skills and resources they need to shape the future of mobility together with us.”

Dr. Joachim Post, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Purchasing and Supplier Network , added: “Quality is an attitude that accompanies us every day. With the Neue Klasse, we are raising the bar – for ourselves and our supplier network. It is only through excellent collaboration and continuous training that we can ensure that our premium quality standards are maintained along the entire value chain.”

“Better together” – for top performance on both sides The motto of the Partner Academy says it all: “Better together”. A team that continuously develops and acquires new knowledge works together more efficiently, raises quality levels and lays the foundation for success and growth. Toprak Razgatlioglu concluded: “I didn’t do it on my own – that´s teamwork.”
