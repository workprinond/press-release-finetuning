Munich. BMW and MINI will be hosting attention-grabbing stands at the Japan Mobility Show 2025. Taking to the stage in Tokyo on 31 October – 9 November will be a host of future-focused BMW and MINI models and technologies, including the first new Neue Klasse model BMW iX3, hydrogen fuel cell technology, the MINI family including new MINI Paul Smith Edition, the special-edition BMW M2 CS* and the BMW Concept Speedtop concept car. BMW Motorrad will also be represented at the event – in the form of the fully electric BMW CE 02 and the BMW M 1000 RR ridden by Toprak Razgatlıoğlu to his second successive FIM Superbike World Championship crown in 2025. [ADDRESS] and 30 October, representatives of the international media will have an early opportunity to take in the compelling exhibits from the three brands at the 1,100-square-metre stand in Tokyo’s Big Sight exhibition centre. Visitors to the show can also experience in-car gaming with AirConsole, which is making its debut with BMW Operating [ADDRESS].5. The new BMW iX3 will be among the vehicles offering customers this function, which brings with it world-renowned titles such as UNO® Car Party!, Hot Wheels: Xtreme Overdrive TM and PAC-MAN TM Championship Edition.

Asian premiere for the new BMW iX3, the first new Neue Klasse model.

The Japan Mobility Show will host the Asian premiere of the first new Neue Klasse model: the BMW iX3. Lining up alongside the iX3 will be revolutionary technologies that point the way to the future of the BMW Group as a whole. Visitors to the Japan Mobility Show will see the new BMW iX3 reveal technological leaps forward in a host of different areas: electric mobility, display and control/operation concept, digitalisation, connectivity, design and sustainability. All future BMW models will benefit from the innovations brought by the Neue Klasse – regardless of the type of drive system they use.

Production of the BMW iX3 for Japan is scheduled to begin in March 2026, with sales through the Japanese BMW dealer network currently due to begin in the second half of 2026. The BMW iX3 launches an all-new design language for the BMW brand that faithfully conveys the technological advances achieved. The revolutionary display and control/operation concept BMW Panoramic iDrive with the new BMW Panoramic Vision and new BMW Operating System X redefines the user experience and creates flawless driver orientation in the BMW mould. The zonal electronics architecture featuring four high-performance computers – the “superbrains” – provides the basis for the software-defined vehicle. One of these high-performance computers is the Heart of Joy: with the BMW Dynamic Performance Control software developed fully in-house, it can manage the driving characteristics of the overall vehicle from a standstill to the dynamic limit. As the first new Neue Klasse model – with sixth-generation (Gen6) BMW eDrive, cylindrical-cell battery and new electric motors – the new BMW iX3 embodies major technological progress. A maximum charging rate of 400 kW enables 372 km (231 miles) of range to be added in ten minutes, and bidirectional charging functions turn the car into a powerbank on wheels.

The new BMW iX5 Hydrogen* from 2028.

Product diversity continues to be a key success factor for the BMW Group. A wide-ranging portfolio of drive systems – encompassing internal combustion engines, plug-in hybrids, battery-electric drive systems and, starting with the new BMW iX5 Hydrogen in 2028, hydrogen fuel cell technology – lays the foundations for successfully meeting the varying demands and needs of customers worldwide both now and in the future.

The hydrogen drive technology is based on the third-generation fuel cell system that the BMW Group is developing in collaboration with the Toyota Motor Corporation. This technological advance paves the way for a system with a more compact design that is also more powerful and efficient, thereby increasing range and output at the same time as reducing energy consumption. Competence centres in Munich and at BMW Group Plant Steyr are building initial prototypes for this technology. And BMW Group Plant Landshut is supplying additional components for the drive system.

World premiere for the MINI Paul Smith Edition.

Back in 1998, Paul Smith lent his signature to a limited-run edition of the classic Mini. And MINI and the British designer have since linked up to bring a number of other projects to fruition. Fast forward to the present day and the Japan Mobility Show 2025 will provide the setting for the latest milestone in this tradition-steeped collaboration: the world premiere of the new MINI Paul Smith Edition. For this special-edition car, Paul Smith brings his world-renowned “classic with a twist” design language to the MINI Cooper family. The styling and details of the cars bring together the unmistakable style of Paul Smith with the playful, upbeat and independent spirit of the MINI brand.

Exclusive exterior colours such as Nottingham Green and sophisticated design elements like the Paul Smith “signature stripe” accentuate the distinctive looks of the MINI Paul Smith Edition. Standard specification for the MINI Paul Smith Edition includes 18-inch Night Flash Spoke black alloy wheels with accents in Dark Steel. And a Paul Smith signature on the wheel trims and black horizontal boot lid handle marks out the special-edition cars. The MINI Paul Smith Edition will be offered for the MINI [ADDRESS]-Door, 5-Door and MINI Cooper Convertible models. Worldwide sales of the fully electric variants of the MINI Paul Smith Edition will get underway with the world premiere at the Japan Mobility Show, while orders for variants with an internal combustion engine will open in the first quarter of 2026.

Japan premiere for the special-edition BMW M2 CS.

The special-edition BMW M2 CS is celebrating its Japanese premiere at the BMW Group stand at the Japan Mobility Show 2025. Its high-revving six-cylinder in-line engine with M TwinTurbo technology – an upgraded version of the unit found in the standard M2 – develops an impressive 390 kW/530 hp at 6,250 rpm. In so doing, the compact high-performance sports car from BMW M GmbH raises the bar for undiluted driving pleasure a notch higher still.

The standard-fitted eight-speed M Steptronic transmission with Drivelogic sends the engine’s power to the rear wheels of the BMW M2 CS. Judicious application of lightweight design techniques including the use of carbon-fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP) reduces the weight of the special edition by around 30 kilograms compared to the standard M2. Thanks to the car’s lighter weight and lightning-fast power delivery, the BMW M2 CS is able to break the four-second barrier for the sprint from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) with a time of 3.8 seconds. The figure calculated using the “1-foot rollout” method** is 3.5 seconds. The mid-range sprint from 80 to 120 km/h (50 – 75 mph) takes 3.4 seconds and top speed is electronically limited to 302 km/h (188 mph). The chassis technology and braking system of the BMW M2 CS are precisely tailored to the uprated performance characteristics of the engine and the specific weight balance of the special edition, which has an eight-millimetre-lower ride height.

The striking exterior of the BMW M2 CS is headlined by a host of components made from CFRP and exclusive details such as the M exterior mirror caps familiar from the BMW M2*, the M Carbon roof – which comes as standard on the special-edition model – and the CS-specific rear diffusor. The interior of the new BMW M2 CS combines an exclusive look with the sporty feel of exquisite Alcantara and innovative lightweight design, examples of which include the CFRP centre console and the weight-optimised, heated M Carbon front bucket seats finished in Merino leather.

With in-car gaming via AirConsole, users can enjoy world-renowned classic titles.

Visitors to the BMW Group stand in Tokyo can also experience in-car gaming via AirConsole, as introduced for the first time with BMW Operating [ADDRESS].5. The new BMW iX3 will offer this feature, which comes with world-renowned titles like the classic card game UNO® from Mattel – here tailored for in-car gaming and renamed “UNO® Car Party!”. Mattel, Inc. (NASDAQ: MAT) is a leading global toy and family entertainment company and owner of one of the most iconic brand portfolios in the world.

BMW customers also gain exclusive access to the Hot Wheels: Xtreme Overdrive TM game that AirConsole – in collaboration with Mattel – has added to its game library. In this game, players can earn points with the virtual BMW Vision Neue Klasse X in races on the Panoramic Drive Track, unlock legendary Hot Wheels cars and customize them. This makes every race a showcase for the performance and style of the BMW Vision Neue Klasse X.

At the same time, AirConsole will also release PAC-MAN™ Championship Edition from Bandai Namco Entertainment Inc. to BMW for the first time. This brand-specific version of the arcade classic has been customized with exclusive BMW items, bringing a unique twist to one of the world’s best known games. AirConsole allows customers to use their smartphones as controllers so that all the passengers on board can play against each other.

BMW Concept Speedtop: the sports Touring, redefined.

Adding a particularly exclusive head-turner to the vehicles on display at the BMW Group’s Japan Mobility Show 2025 stand is the unique BMW Concept Speedtop. This three-door concept car was unveiled for the first time in May this year at the Concorso d´Eleganza Villa d´Este 2025, the renowned celebration of historic vehicles on the shores of Lake Como in Italy. The BMW Concept Speedtop reimagines the sporty Touring model type, blending the elegance of a shooting brake with a fresh design language. The exclusivity of the BMW Concept Speedtop (which will be offered in a strictly limited-run small series of 70 cars) is underscored by its exquisite engine – the most powerful V8 engine currently offered by BMW.

The exterior of the BMW Concept Speedtop is marked out by the pronounced V-shape of the “shark-nose” front end, the slim front lights and the illuminated kidneys. The continuation of the central spline from the bonnet over the roof to the rear spoiler imbues the car with a dynamic Touring profile, its broad haunches further enriching the athletic design. And its elegance is underscored by two-tone, 14-spoke fan-style wheels, which have been designed specifically for the BMW Concept Speedtop. A two-tone colour and materials concept creates a connection between the exterior and interior. The sparkling brown tones of the Floating Sunstone Maroon exterior paint finish are carried over into the cabin in the form of the brown Sundown Maroon colour world with the light Moonstone White of the seats. In addition, skilfully crafted, traditional brogue-style details accentuate the leather-trimmed surfaces and visualise the manufactory-level craftsmanship on display. The boot of the BMW Concept Speedtop is also leather-covered and adorned with brogue-style perforations. The elaborate craftsmanship of the exterior and interior was realised with the expertise of the Manufactory workshop at BMW Group Plant Dingolfing.

BMW X7 meets Japanese craftsmanship.

The BMW X7 Nishiki Lounge concept car presented at the Japan Mobility Show embodies the elegant symbiosis of luxurious driving comfort and traditional Japanese craftsmanship. With space for up to seven people, this attractive concept model based on the BMW X7 also offers high practicality. A tranquil space filled with beauty, where stars twinkle, the BMW X7 Nishiki Lounge creates a gentle, expansive sanctuary. Here in the cabin, the refined brilliance of BMW's exclusive appointments is artistically combined with the vast expanse of a starry sky, crafted using traditional Kyoto techniques.

A dedicated two-tone paint scheme instantly conveys the exclusive aura of the BMW X7 Nishiki Lounge. Complementing the main colour BMW Individual Velvet Blue, the roof section is painted in Space Silver to evoke the shimmer of nebulae shining in the cosmos. The Crystal Light Headlights emit an infinite, jewel-like brilliance, enhanced by gentle Iconic Glow light. The interior features a Panoramic Skyroof with 15,000 LEDs projecting a pale blue starlight at night, while the Bowers & Wilkins Diamond Surround Sound System expresses the light shining on the earth through sound.

BMW R 18: MORE MODERN STYLING

As the purist cruiser of the R 18 family, the revised BMW R 18 now has a more contemporary and dynamic appearance thanks to newly designed front and rear fenders along with an 18-inch rear wheel (previously 16-inch). The wheels are also optionally available in a Contrast Cut design. Here, the cast aluminum wheels are given a glossy polish and then sealed with clear finish. The familiar 19-inch / 16-inch spoked wheels are still available as part of the [ADDRESS] Olivine package.

Extending over the entire length of the gas tank, the new sculptured top section seamlessly continues at the rear fender and ends at the level of the BMW emblem.

The previously rounded front fender is now more modern in appearance thanks to a resculpted raised center section. All three body components, front fender, gas tank and rear fender, now look as if they have been cast from a single piece. The side covers perfectly match this design style with their more marked side contour. The more modern styling is also reflected in the “rough look” of the uncovered fork tubes.

Other features that harmonize with the more dynamic design style are the new silencers with a circular cross-section and the newly resculpted solo seat with softer foam that is 0.4-inches / 10 mm thicker. The significantly more comfortable seat is removable and can be conveniently unlocked using a push button concealed under the seat cover. The new seat height of 28.3 inches (27.2 inches previous) comes from a combination of new seat and wheel/tire combo.

In order to ensure a more comfortable ride, the rear shock has new spring/damping rates. This was tuned to work together with the new 18-inch rear wheel and the new 180/55B18 tire to match. Another new feature is the USB-C charging socket.

The basic version of the BMW R 18 features a silver powertrain, a chrome-plated exhaust system and black cast aluminum wheels. The body color is Black Storm Metallic.

In the optional [ADDRESS] Olivine variant, the R 18 has a black powertrain, the Design Package Aero, surface-enhanced [ADDRESS] Icon cast alloy wheels (19-inch / 16-inch), a chrome-plated exhaust system and the [ADDRESS] seat. The body is finished in Velvet Green Metallic.

The BMW R 18 Style Blacked Out equipment is new and features black elements throughout the entire motorcycle.

BMW R 18 CLASSIC: MORE CLASSIC, MORE AUTHENTIC

The BMW R 18 Classic, likewise benefits from a refined design to further hone its character as a nostalgic touring bike. The most striking new feature is the front fender, adopted from the R 18 B, in conjunction with a new 19-inch spoke front wheel (previously 16-inches). The front fender now incorporates a mudguard extension, which has been significantly lowered for a more stylish effect. The new fender not only harmonizes with the fork covers, still available for the R 18 Classic, but also underlines its connection to the nostalgic touring segment. Together with newly designed side covers and round rear exhaust pipes, the R 18 Classic now has an even more classic and authentic appearance. Another new feature is the USB-C charging socket.

Like the new R 18, the 2025 R 18 Classic features a new seat height; now 28.7-inches vs the previous 28.0-inches.

The BMW R 18 Classic Style Blacked Out equipment option is new and features black elements throughout the motorcycle.

BMW R 18 AND R 18 CLASSIC BLACKED OUT: BLACK, ELEGANT AND EXPRESSIVE.

In the optional Style Blacked Out variant, the BMW R 18 and R 18 Classic look particularly elegant and expressive with a range of equipment finished in Black High Gloss and Dark Chrome.

The optional Style Blacked Out equipment includes a dark finished powertrain, cylinder head covers, engine front cover, airbox cover, fork trim, handlebar, fuel tank rear cover trim, headlight trim ring, airbox cover, pushrod tubes, turn signal housings, foot controls, reverse assist lever, exhaust nut, exhaust system and R 18 badges.

The BMW R 18 Style Blacked Out is available with the Black Storm Metallic, Brooklyn Gray Metallic and Mineral Gray Metallic Matte finishes on the R 18 and with the Brooklyn Gray Metallic finish on the R 18 Classic.

BMW R 18 ROCTANE, R 18 B AND R 18 TRANSCONTINENTAL.

The BMW R 18 Roctane had its market launch in mid-2023, so its design already includes features such as the cast aluminum wheels and the Blacked Out optional equipment. Nonetheless, the R 18 Roctane, the R 18 B and the R 18 Transcontinental have now received updates in terms of equipment, paints and finishes.

The BMW R 18 Roctane is now available in Two-Tone Dragonfire Red Metallic. Also new are optional body colored Filler Panels, which visually make the gap between the side cases and the rear fender disappear, and the Dark Chrome finish for the pushrod tubes, airbox cover and headlight inner ring.

The BMW R 18 B features a favorites button on the right-hand handlebar instrument panel, which provides quick access to functions such as direct activation of the grip heating – without having to go through the instrument console menu using the Multicontroller. A switch for the central locking system used to be located here. This has been replaced by the favorites button. The central locking system can still be conveniently controlled using the remote control key.

The items included in the optional Style Blacked Out are the black powertrain, black equipment and an exhaust system in Dark Chrome. The optional [ADDRESS] Black Pearl now also includes the pushrod tubes and airbox cover in Dark Chrome. Also new are the optional body colored Filler Panels.

The standard version of the BMW R 18 Transcontinental is available in the new Two-Tone Dragonfire Red Metallic and now comes with the favorites button as standard. The new body finish is supplemented exclusively with a Black powertrain as well as pushrod tubes and airbox cover in Dark Chrome.

Gurugram. BMW Group India is the long-term presenting partner of the 16th edition of India Art Fair, which will take place from 6 to 9 February 2025 at the NSIC Exhibition Grounds in New Delhi. India Art Fair is the leading platform showcasing modern and contemporary art from India and South Asia and convenes audiences to explore a record 120 exhibitors, including 78 galleries, presented alongside major regional and international art institutions. The fair welcomes 26 new exhibitors, including seven new design studios in its expanded Design section features eleven eminent design studios from India and beyond. For its biggest edition yet, India Art Fair continues in its mission to showcase the very best of South Asian art alongside major contemporary international artists and collectible design by pioneering studios, reinforcing its position as the leading site for the discovery of art and culture in the region.

Mr. Vikram Pawah, President and CEO, BMW Group India: "BMW Group India is a steadfast champion of the arts and cultural landscape across India. We take immense pride in our creative collaboration with the India Art Fair, as it continues to champion India's diverse and thriving contemporary arts landscape. Our shared vision for a future that is both creative and sustainable is perfectly encapsulated by the latest edition of 'The Future is Born of Art' Commission. This groundbreaking initiative explores how the harmonious integration of ecological and technological thinking can create a more sustainable, balanced, and regenerative world - all through the captivating lens of an artist's vision. We eagerly await the opportunity to welcome audiences from India and around the globe at the fair, where they will experience the transformative power of art and technology, united in the pursuit of a better tomorrow."

‘The Future is Born of Art’ Commission ‘The Future is Born of Art’ Commission, led by BMW India and India Art Fair is an annual commission designed to platform a promising young Indian artist on a global stage. Now in its fourth edition, the 2025 Commission invited emerging artists to propose an immersive installation centred around BMW iX1 LWB, MINI Countryman Electric and BMW Motorrad CE 02 and BMW Motorrad CE 04, reflecting on the theme of ‘Ecocentrism’. ‘Ecocentrism’ puts forward a worldview in which ecological and technological thinking coexist, imagining visions for a brighter, more sustainable future.

As winners of the prestigious ‘Future is Born of Art’ Commission, led by BMW and India Art Fair, Non-Linear (Dennis Peter) and Cursorama (Yash Chandak) join the ranks of India’s most promising artistic voices. The annual commission challenges emerging artists to create large-scale installations that explore topical themes built on shared values of BMW and India Art Fair. Previous winners, Sashikanth Thavudoz (2024), Devika Sundar (2023) and Faiza Hasan (2022), have set the stage with visionary works exploring community, materiality and ecology.

Non-Linear and Cursorama’s winning project, Biolume , is an ambitious 180-degree multimedia experience inspired by bioluminescent organisms. With interactive screens that respond to audience movements, the installation creates a feedback loop between human actions and their immersive environment. The space is filled with original sound, ranging from serene melodies to glitchy soundscapes. The installation has three dynamic scenes:

Biolume integrates generative design and biomimicry to place audiences inside an abstracted, glowing oceanic world. “Bioluminescence is nature’s sci-fi—a glowing, electric language that exists in harmony with its surroundings,” Peter explains. The project underscores the role of art as a tool for fostering ecological and social dialogue. “As artists, we see it as our responsibility to reflect on how technology and art can inspire change,” says the duo.

BMW Art Talk On the theme of ‘From Introspection to Impact: Artists Shaping the World’ a BMW Art Talk will be held on 7 February 2025 at the India Art Fair. This talk allows for a deeper introspection into the practices of artists by renowned artists Shirazeh Houshiary, Bharti Kher and Pushpamala N. with moderator Prof. Dr Thomas Girst, Head of Cultural Engagement, BMW Group . In a polarised world, artists allow us to see beyond the surface level – to think more deeply and be challenged, and to create spaces for kinship and solidarity across borders and generations. In keeping track of how the world has evolved, artists punctuate these moments with their art and bridge cultural ecosystems which is the DNA of BMW’s role in art and culture.

BMW Group India Cultural Engagement The BMW Group has initiated and been engaged in hundreds of global cultural initiatives for over 50 years. From music to film, from architecture to design, contemporary art has played an essential role – via long-term institutional partnerships with major museums or partnering with the leading art fairs around the world, such as Art Basel and Frieze from Los Angeles, New York and Miami, to Seoul, Hong kong, Paris, and London.

Since its inception, BMW India has participated in leading cultural engagements across the country. In 2007, two BMW Art Cars embellished by world-renowned artists Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein were presented at the Jehangir Art Gallery in Mumbai. BMW Art Car by Andy Warhol, Jeff Koons, Sandro Chia and Cesar Manrique have been exclusively showcased at various editions of the India Art Fair.

Munich. The record-breaking journey of BMW M GmbH continues: In the 2024 fiscal year, the sports car manufacturer of BMW reached a new all-time high in vehicle sales for the 13th consecutive year. [ADDRESS],582 vehicles, BMW M GmbH once again improved the benchmark, after having exceeded the threshold of 200,000 vehicles sold for the first time in the company's history the previous year. The impressive performance capabilities of the performance and high-performance vehicles are reflected in the growing demand across model classes, drive types, and regions.

The all-electric BMW i4 M50* was the best-selling model for the third time in a row. It transfers the typical M combination of agility, dynamics, and precision into the world of electromobility: With an electric motor at the front and rear axle, which together generate a maximum output of 400 kW/544 hp, the Gran Coupé offers a fascinating driving experience with a range of up to 522 kilometers according to WLTP. But vehicles with other drive systems also saw increases.

"The high demand for both gasoline-powered and electric models shows that our technology-neutral strategy is also paying off in the performance and high-performance segment, driving us to record results," says Sylvia Neubauer, Head of Customer, Brand and Sales at BMW M GmbH. "Anyone looking for a sporty driving experience will always find it at BMW M - in every vehicle category and drive variant."

The unbroken demand for vehicles with outstanding driving performance is also reflected in the growing share that BMW M models contribute to the success of the entire BMW Group. In 2024, almost every tenth vehicle sold was an M model (9.4% share). This is also a new record high.

High-performance models drive growth at top speed.

The biggest growth drivers in the 2024 fiscal year were the high-performance models, which combine untamed racetrack power with unrestricted road capability. After the 2024 model revisions of the BMW M2*, BMW M3*, and BMW M4* model series, as well as the new editions of the BMW M5* and BMW M5 Touring*, the segment is shining with top performances: The BMW M2 achieved a 64% increase, making it the top performer in terms of growth dynamics. With its muscular proportions and powerful design features, the model athlete makes no secret of its performance capabilities, which are embodied by the optimized M TwinPower Turbo straight-six-cylinder engine with 353 kW/480 hp. The M3 Touring* grew by +57%.

The high-performance segment is also increasingly electrifying more customers. The BMW XM*, as the first electrified high-performance model, recorded a sales increase of 16%. It combines pioneering drive technology with a spectacular vehicle concept: The specially developed M HYBRID System of the Sports Activity Vehicle mobilizes a maximum output of up to 550 kW/748 hp in the top model BMW XM Label*. Uncompromising design and fascinating performance create maximum exclusivity and make the BMW XM a completely new model in the luxury segment.

Overall, the high-performance models crossed the finish line in the 2024 fiscal year with 66,805 vehicles sold and an increase of 8%. "More customers than ever before worldwide are enthusiastic about the typical BMW M combination of expressive design with extensive individualization options, highly dynamic driving performance, and perfection in manufacturing," says Sylvia Neubauer. "The M evokes emotions: All our models have motorsport genes and stand for driving pleasure at the highest level."

International lead of M models continues to grow.

In both the performance segment and the particularly exclusive high-performance area, BMW M GmbH is leading the international competition and further increased its lead in the 2024 fiscal year. Thus, BMW M remains at the top with a large gap to the core competitors. In the USA and the UK, as well as in Germany, BMW M is the market leader among sports car manufacturers. "In the three largest markets, we are number one with a clear lead," says Franciscus van Meel, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW M GmbH. "This expression of trust motivates us to deliver another strong performance in 2025, despite the continued highly challenging economic environment."

Further expansion of model diversity in focus.

With the further expansion of model diversity, BMW M GmbH is setting accents in 2025 as well. On the agenda are various special models and model revisions with innovations for combustion engines, plug-in hybrids, and electric drives alike. In addition, the development of the new all-electric BMW M3 is progressing. "Our offering spans the entire range of BMW models and includes performance and high-performance variants with all-electric, partially electric, and purely combustion-powered drives," says van Meel. "We will continue to pursue and further develop this successful strategy."

BMW M Motorsport provides emotions, success, and strong sales figures.

Another focus is on motorsport. In 2024, the return to the FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC) of BMW M GmbH earned, among other things, a podium finish in the GT3 class at the legendary 24 Hours of Le Mans. The BMW M Hybrid V8 Art Car by artist Julie Mehretu also caused a sensation among the more than 300,000 spectators on site and the sports and culture media worldwide. In the past season, the three current BMW M Motorsport racing vehicles, the BMW M Hybrid V8, the BMW M4 GT3, and the BMW M4 GT4, together celebrated 215 victories, completed more than 1,000 races, and covered over one million kilometers. In 2025, the focus will be on successes with the BMW M Hybrid V8 in the FIA WEC and the North American IMSA series. On the customer motorsport side, the EVO versions of the BMW M4 GT3 and the BMW M4 GT4 are entering their debut seasons. Both vehicles are selling extremely successfully and demonstrate the extraordinary popularity of BMW M Motorsport products with customers around the world.

# Forward momentum through technology openness, strong product line-up and NEUE KLASSE: BMW Group on track for growth in 2025
## +++ 2025: Slight Growth planned in sales volume +++ Group EBT targeted at previous year’s level +++ Higher Free cash flow expected +++ Slight Increase of BEV share in total sales planned +++ Due to a consistent strategy: Investments set to decrease from planned peak in 2024 +++ Technology openness as strategic competitive advantage +++ First NEUE KLASSE production vehicle will be the BMW iX3 +++
Date: 2025-03-14 | Author: Britta Ullrich BMW Group | ID: T0448841EN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Munich. The BMW Group is entering the financial year 2025 with a clear commitment to growth – with a planned slight increase in sales volume, a decrease in investments and robust free cash flow.

“What has always set the BMW Group apart is our ability to maintain our course, even in challenging conditions. We remain clearly focused on two things – our near term performance and our long-term perspective,” said [EXECUTIVE_OFFICER], Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG , on Friday. “With the NEUE KLASSE, we are implementing the biggest future-focused project in the history of our company, while at the same time achieving a robust free cash flow.”

At the end of this year, the first production model of the NEUE KLASSE , the new BMW iX3 , will kick off an unprecedented ramp-up of new models: Across all drivetrain variants and all segments, the BMW Group will release more than 40 new and updated vehicles onto the market by 2027 . What these new models have in common is that they will be equipped with future technology clusters, which will be rolled out successively across the entire portfolio with the launch of the NEUE KLASSE.

“We are taking a huge leap forward with our new technology clusters – achieving maximum scalability, increasing the level of innovation and enhancing customer benefits. We do not differentiate between segments or drivetrain technologies – we provide every customer with the latest technology,” said Zipse .

Consistent implementation of strategy

The BMW Group made extensive investments in innovative technologies, its model line-up and manufacturing footprint worldwide in 2024. There will be a decrease in expenditure this year, from the planned peak in R&D spending and capital expenditure last year. On this basis, the company is aiming for a profit before taxes at the previous year’s level – despite increased tariffs.

“Never before in the history of BMW have we invested so extensively in our future. Investment reached its highest level in 2024, as planned. This underlines the durability of our strategy – and how consistently we are implementing it,” said Walter Mertl, member of the Board of Management, Finance .

Technology openness as strategic success factor in global competition

The diversity of its product range remains a key success factor for the BMW Group: The company is well positioned to meet globally diverse requirements and customer needs – both today and in the future – with a broad drivetrain portfolio spanning internal combustion engines, plug-in hybrids, battery-electric drive trains and, starting in 2028, also fuel-cell electric vehicles powered by hydrogen.

Highly efficient internal combustion engines , which remain in high demand worldwide, will continue to play a key role. Last year alone, the company released more than 15 new or updated models with internal combustion engines onto the roads. All engines have been approved for higher percentages of renewable fuels for years . Fuels with lower CO 2 content are the most effective way to reduce the carbon footprint of the existing fleet of over 250 million vehicles in Europe alone, making a valuable contribution to the transport sector’s efforts in the fight against climate change.

Battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) remain the BMW Group’s main growth driver . The company’s broad all-electric offer comprises more than 15 models across all brands . This means the BMW Group has a fully-electric offer in all its main segments. In 2024, the BMW Group significantly increased its total BEV sales worldwide to 426,536 units (+13.5%), representing a sales share of more than 17%. At MINI, about one in four vehicles is fully-electric; at Rolls-Royce, it is already one in three.

Plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) also remain an essential element of the BMW Group’s technology-open approach and electrification of its model range: State-of-the-art BMW PHEV models enable an all-electric range of over 100 kilometres, thus making it relevant for a large proportion of typical driving situations and also making a substantial contribution to CO 2 reduction. In total, the BMW Groupdelivered nearly 600,000 electrified vehicles including plug-in hybrids (PHEVs and BEVs) to customers in 2024. This means almost one in four vehicles sold was electrified .

Electrified deliveries reach new all-time high – important milestones in 2025

The company will reach two major milestones in 2025: first, three million electrified vehicles on the roads since the launch of the BMW i3 and BMW i8 and, second, 1.5 million fully-electric vehicles delivered to customers.

The decrease in the CO 2 emissions of the new vehicle fleet also underlines the effectiveness of technology openness: Based on preliminary figures, the BMW Group was able to reduce its EU fleet emissions to below 100 grams of CO 2 per kilometre (WLTP) for the first time in 2024.

First hydrogen production vehicle to be released in 2028

In 2028, the BMW Group will become the first premium manufacturer worldwide to release a series production fuel-cell vehicle, offering its customers another emission-free drivetrain option. To this end, the BMW Group is deepening its cooperation with Toyota Motor Corporation: Both partners will jointly develop the drive system for passenger cars, which will then be used in a brand-specific way in the two manufacturers’ respective models. The planned BMW vehicle will fit seamlessly into the brand’s portfolio, where it will be available alongside other drive train options.

NEUE KLASSE is laying the foundation – BMW iX3 will be first production vehicle

Series production of the NEUE KLASSE will get underway in late 2025. The first production vehicle of this new generation of BMW models will have the model name BMW iX3 . Series production of this SAV model, which was foreshadowed by the BMW Vision Neue Klasse X last year, will begin late this year at Plant Debrecen – the first plant in the BMW Group production network to exclusively build fully-electric vehicles. Since late 2024, the plant has been producing pre-series vehicles for testing.

The BMW iX3 kicks off an unprecedented model ramp-up up to 2027 : The launches of more than 40 models of all drivetrain variants will follow in quick succession; including a sporty sedan that is core to the BMW brand, which will be launched in 2026.

With the series launch of the BMW iX3, the new technology clusters will also be integrated throughout the entire BMW product line-up based on the established modularity principle. With this development, the BMW Group has achieved a high level of innovation : Numerous patents were successfully registered – for example, for electric motor components, display projection technologies and driving dynamics control functions. This means that all future BMW models will benefit from the innovations of the NEUE KLASSE - as well as from the new design language .

Digital nervous system for “Software-Defined Vehicle”

For the next stage in its customer and driving experience, the BMW Group has completely redesigned the components, functionality and connectivity its “Software-Defined Vehicle”. The result is an entirely restructured digital nervous system – consisting of a new electrical system with zonal architecture, a refined software architecture and four “super-brains”. These high-performance computers cluster the computing power for key customer functionality around infotainment, automated driving, driving dynamics and basic functions, such as vehicle access, air conditioning and comfort. In this way, the BMW Group is centralising and significantly reducing the number of electronic control units, while simultaneously providing well over 20 times more in-car computing power in the vehicle. This already ensures that the electronic control units will also be capable of accommodating future software and function updates, including AI features.

The zonal architecture comprising four zones, will substantially increase the vehicle's efficiency: On the one hand, this radically simplifies the electrical system – 600 metres less wiring also reduces weight by 30%. On the other hand, the use of “smart eFuses” allows unnecessary energy consumption to be deactivated in certain situations, such as when the vehicle is parked or charging. Developers are working on well over 1,000 software modules with more than 500 million lines of code to further enhance the software architecture of the new digital “nervous system”.

Overall, the redesign of the electronics architecture enables a quantum leap in performance, integration capability and efficiency . New innovations can be relayed much faster to the vehicle through over-the-air upgrades, ensuring the car remains up-to-date – even when the next vehicle generation is already on the market. Over the course of the year, the BMW Group targets to increase the number of “over the air update” capable vehicles on the roads to over ten million.

Next-level driving experience

Ten times faster than previous systems, developed entirely in-house and delivering maximum integration – with the “Heart of Joy” and new “BMW Dynamic Performance Control ”, the BMW Group is set to achieve a quantum leap in driving experience : For the first time, the new highly integrated control unit – that will be used in every fully-electric BMW in the future – combines drivetrain and driving dynamics functions. Integrated control of the drive train, braking and recuperation takes efficiency to the next level: [ADDRESS]% of driving situations, the conventional brake does not need to intervene – the recuperation braking power is sufficient. As a result, the “Heart of Joy” increases overall efficiency by up to 25%.

The performance capabilities and potential of the “Heart of Joy” are showcased in the BMW Vision Driving Experience . In this new high-performance test vehicle, the functionality of the electronic control unit is tested under extreme conditions: The Vision Vehicle develops a torque of up to 18,000 Nm. The logic behind this: If the system can handle such a powerful high-performance vehicle, it will also be capable of managing the requirements of future production models. The BMW Vision Driving Experience will showcase the capabilities of the “Heart of Joy” in April at the Auto Shanghai 2025.

Focus on driver orientation: The new BMW Panoramic iDrive

More than 20 years ago, the BMW Group set the benchmark for driver orientation and intuitive operability with its iDrive system. Starting in the new BMW iX3, the company is taking the next step by launching a completely new display and a new highly intelligent operating system. The clear objective is to reinterpret the brand’s hallmark “hands on the wheel, eyes on the road” approach and develop it into the future.

With “BMW Panoramic iDrive”, the central interface for driver-vehicle interaction is being totally redesigned . At the heart of this new system is BMW Panoramic Vision – a completely newly-developed concept that projects content across the full width of the windscreen. It is rounded off by three other new components: the BMW 3D head-up display, the central display and the multifunction steering wheel. The entire system is operated either by touch or voice control via BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant, which is taken to a new level through a Large Language Model (LLM).

The intelligent backbone of the new Panoramic iDrive is formed by the new BMW Operating System X, which was developed entirely in-house and is based on an Android Open Source Project (AOSP) software stack, delivering significant update and upgrade capabilities. The new operating system enables optimal coordination and distribution of content in the vehicle across Panoramic iDrive’s four elements. At the same time, it offers customers maximum personalisation and customisation, tailored to their individual preferences and needs.

Sixth-generation BMW eDrive technology

The BMW Group is launching the sixth generation of its eDrive technology in the electric models of the NEUE KLASSE. The system comprises three significantly enhanced components: the high-voltage battery, the electric motor and the “BMW Energy Master”: The latter operates as the control unit for the entire electric drive system, has been developed completely in-house and will be manufactured in the BMW Group Plant in Landshut.

In the future, the BMW Group will use round cells and an 800-volt system for its high-voltage battery. This combination heralds a major breakthrough at both cell and vehicle levels: 20% higher energy density, 30% faster charging and at least 30% more range . The round cells are integrated and wired directly into the battery housing. With this new concept, the BMW Group is aiming to reduce costs for the high voltage battery by 40 to 50 percent.**

For its e-drive , the BMW Group relies on a highly flexible and scalable modular system . The basis for this is provided by DC-excited Synchronous Motors (SSMs) that are developed and produced in-house. Vehicles with xDrive come with the option of Asynchronous Motors (ASMs) installed on the front axle, reducing energy loss by 40% and weight by 10%. In the future, customers will be able to choose between models with one, two, three or four electric motors.

Strong brands, diversified product portfolio

The foundation of the BMW Group’s success lies in its fresh and attractive product line-up across all segments . In 2024, with the new BMW X3, the BMW brand unveiled the fourth generation of one of its best-selling models. Within the past two years, the BMW Group has thoroughly updated its product range in two high-volume segments : In the entry-level segment, the new generations of the BMW 1 Series and BMW 2 Series Gran Coupé were released onto the market. In BMW’s core segment, both the BMW 3 Series and BMW 4 Series were further developed. Following the update to the BMW iX*, this model now provides a fully-electric range of over 700 kilometres in the WLTP cycle.

In 2024, M GmbH posted record sales for the 13th consecutive year , building on its broad and diverse model line-up, including the BMW M3 CS Touring*, BMW M5 Sedan* and BMW M5 Touring*, among others. One in ten BMW brand vehicles features M technology.

With the launch of the new MINI Convertible*, the New MINI Family is now complete, comprising five models in total.

Rolls-Royce recently introduced its s econd fully-electric vehicle, Black Badge Spectre *. The company is also investing 300 million pounds in its Goodwood production site to further expand its Bespoke and Coachbuild offerings.

BMW Motorrad reported its highest-ever sales last year . This success can be attributed to its highly sought-after GS models, the new heritage models of the R12 series and the high-performance long-distance sports models from the four-cylinder series, among others.

As planned, future investments reach new all-time high in 2024

Systematically and with strong momentum, the BMW Group is working on extensive future model updates and technology innovations including electrification and digitalisation across all model series. To this end, the company invested more than € 18 billion in R&D and capital expenditure linked to new products and facilities in the 2024 financial year . The company will further strengthen its global production network with the construction of the new plant in Debrecen (Hungary) – where series production of the new BMW iX3 will begin at the end of this year – along with the development of five high voltage battery assembly facilities and the extensive refurbishment of the Munich plant.

BMW Group meets adjusted business targets for 2024, as forecast

As projected, the company achieved its adjusted business targets for 2024, which were set in September. The guidance adjustment was triggered by the financial effects of delivery stops and recalls in connection with the supplied Integrated Brake System (IBS) component and continuing subdued demand in the Chinese market. Outside of China, the BMW Group benefited from growing customer demand for its attractive premium vehicles: Excluding China, the BMW brand achieved growth of 4.1% for the full year and was able to expand its position as number one in the segment worldwide. The BMW Group reported revenues for the full year of € 142,380 million (2023: € 155,498 million; -8.4%).

Investment in the future reach a new high with NEUE KLASSE

Expenditure for research and development increased significantly, as planned, to € 9,078 million (2023: € 7,755 million/+17.1%). The R&D ratio for the full year was 6.4% (2023: 5.0%). As planned, the BMW Group’s capital expenditure for the full year climbed to € 9,056 million (2023: € 8,836 million/+2.5%). The capex ratio for the 12-month period rose to 6.4% (2023: 5.7%). The company expects its investments in future projects to decrease, starting in 2025.

Group earnings (EBT) in line with adjusted guidance

In 2024, the BMW Group reported Group earnings before tax (EBT) of €10,971 million (2023: € 17,096 million/-35.8%). The Group EBT margin came in at 7.7% (2023: 11.0%). In the fourth quarter of 2024, the BMW Group earned a margin of 5.8% (Q4/ 2023: 8.6%). Group net profit amounted to € 7,678 million (2023: € 12,165 million/-36.9%).

Automotive Segment EBIT margin at 6.3%

Automotive Segment earnings before financial result (EBIT) totalled € 7,893 million in 2024 (2023: € 12,981 million/ -39.2%). In the second half of 2024, in particular, the operating result was impacted by the market situation in China and delivery stops linked to Integrated Braking System (IBS). The EBIT margin came in at 6.3% (2023: 9.8%), which was within the adjusted target range of 6-7%. Excluding depreciation and amortisation for BBA assets from the purchase price allocation, the EBIT margin was 7.4%. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the segment earned a margin of 5.5% – excluding the BBA depreciation, EBT totalled approx. € 2.2 billion in the final quarter of the year, with an EBT margin of 6.5%.

The Automotive Segment’s free cash flow for the full year totalled € 4,852 million (2023: € 6,942 million) – despite realized future investments of € 18.2 bn. Largely due to a planned significant reduction in inventories, the BMW Group achieved a free cash flow of € 5,043 million in the fourth quarter (2023: € 1,183 million/+326%). In 2025, the segment’s free cash flow is expected to benefit from lower capital expenditure and land above €5 billion.

In the Financial Services Segment , the BMW Group reported solid growth in the number of new contracts with retail customers for new and used vehicles in 2024, with a significantly higher financing volume per contract. The penetration rate new BMW Group vehicles leased or financed by the Financial Services Segment climbed to 42.6%duringthe reporting year (2023: 38.2%/ +4.4 percentage points).

Earnings before tax (EBT) for the full year 2024 amounted to € 2,538 million (2023: € 2,962 million/-14.3%). Earnings development reflected the expected lowerincome from the resale of end-of-lease vehicles year-on-year, which nevertheless remains positive on average per vehicle. Additionally, earnings were impacted by higher provisions for credit and residual value risks, and additional allocations to provisions.

Higher payout ratio – dividend of € 4.30 proposed

Accounting for the payout ratio target range of 30 40% of net profit attributable to the shareholders of BMW AG and subject to the approval of the Annual General Meeting on 14 May 2025, thecompany’s unappropriated profit (according to the German Commercial Code) of € 2,677 million (2023: € 3,802 million/-29.6%) will be distributed to shareholders from BMW AG’s net profit. This represents the highest ever payout ratio of 36.7% (2023: 33.7%). Accordingly, the Board of Management and Supervisory Board will propose a dividend of € 4.30 per share of common stock (2023: € 6.00) and € 4.32 per share of preferred stock (2023: € 6.02). This makes the dividend for fiscal year 2024 the fourth highest in the company’s history.

In addition, share buybacks remain a solid pillar of the shareholder return strategy. Since authorization by the 2022 Annual General Meeting, the BMW Group has acquired a total of 6.35% of the share capital as of [ADDRESS], 2024. By April 2025, the company will have purchased a total of 4 billion euros in shares. At the Annual General Meeting on [ADDRESS], BMW AG will request a further authorization to buy back additional shares amounting to 10 percent of the existing share capital within the next five years.

“The BMW Group has consistently implemented its shareholder return strategy, even in the challenging financial year 2024. The highest payout ratio ever agreed in the history of BMW AG results in a dividend of €4.30 . In addition to our reliable annual dividends, our shareholders benefit from our share buyback programmes. Of course, our employees also benefit from the company’s success: They participate in it through our profit-sharing scheme and discounted share purchase options,” said CFO Mertl .

Number of employees higher year-on-year

The BMW Group employed 159,104 employees at the end of 2024 (2023: 154,950/ +2.7%). This slight increase in employee numbers was, as planned, due to the ramp-up of the NEUE KLASSE, primarily in development, IT and the BMW Group’s global production network.

Detailed guidance for financial year 2025

The BMW Group anticipates the following developments during financial year 2025: Inflation continues to stabilize and further moderate interest rate cuts in many countries suggest that demand will rise slightly in 2025. With the full availability of new models — the BMW 5 Series, the BMW X3 and the renewed MINI model range, as well as the new BMW 2 Series Gran Coupé — the company expects slight growth in sales overall. The share of all-electric vehicles in deliveries will increase slightly compared to 2024.

The electrification and digitization strategy will continue in 2025; however, costs and investments are expected to decline after the 2024 peak. At the same time, the continued challenging situation in China, tariff increases and ongoing support measures for the supply chain are expected to provide headwinds.

This guidance takes into account the effects of the tariff increases that came into force up to [ADDRESS]. In view of the aforementioned aspects, Group earnings before taxes will beexpected on previous year’s level*** . An EBIT margin in the range of 5.0 to 7.0% is expectedin the Automotive segment . The Automotive Segment RoCE should be within a range of 9 to 13%.

RoE in the Financial Services segment is forecast to be in the range of 13 to 16%.

In the Motorcycles Segment , a slight increase in sales and an EBIT margin within the target range of 5.5 to 7.5%are forecast, with an RoCE of 13 to 17%.

The above targets will be achieved with the current number of employees .

The actual business performance of BMW Group may deviate from current expectations, i.e. due to changes in political and macroeconomic conditions. Among other things, the currently anticipated intensification of global trade conflicts, in the form of further tariff increases, could have a negative impact.

GLOSSARY – explanatory comments on key performance indicators

Deliveries to customers

A new or used vehicle is recorded as a delivery once it is handed over to the end user (which also includes leaseholders under lease contracts with BMW Financial Services). In the US and Canada, end users also include (1) dealers when they designate a vehicle as a service loaner or demonstrator vehicle and (2) dealers and other third parties when they purchase a company vehicle at auction and dealers when they purchase company vehicles directly from the BMW Group. Deliveries may be made by BMW AG, one of its international subsidiaries, a BMW Group retail outlet, or independent third-party dealers. The vast majority of deliveries – and hence the reporting of deliveries to the BMW Group – is made by independent third-party dealers. Retail vehicle deliveries during a given reporting period do not correlate directly to the revenues that the BMW Group recognises in respect of that particular reporting period.

Payout ratio

The payout ratio is preliminary. Although the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board will propose a fixed dividend per share at the Annual General Meeting, the number of shares entitled to a dividend is expected to fall by the Annual General Meeting due to the ongoing share buy-back programme. Accordingly, the total amount to be distributed to shareholders by 14 May is also still expected to change.

Profit before financial result. Profit before financial result comprises revenues less cost of sales, less selling and administrative expenses and plus/minus net other operating income and expenses.

EBIT margin

Profit/loss before financial result as a percentage of revenues.

EBIT plus financial result.

Plug-in-hybrid electric vehicle - hybrid vehicle with petrol engine and electric drive.

# BMW NA 50th Anniversary | 50 Stories for 50 Years [ADDRESS]: “Bob Lutz: The New BMW AG Board Member Shakes up the Worldwide Distribution System” Written by: Jackie Jouret
## Within the automotive industry, Bob Lutz is legendary as a Car Guy, an executive who prioritized exciting, fun-to-drive cars over those with mass-market appeal. During his brief tenure as BMW’s board member for sales, Lutz fulfilled those expectations handily, fostering the creation of enthusiast-oriented cars like the 2002 turbo and 3.0 CSL, and by founding BMW Motorsport to put BMW back on the racetrack with a full-factory team.

Within the automotive industry, Bob Lutz is legendary as a Car Guy, an executive who prioritized exciting, fun-to-drive cars over those with mass-market appeal. During his brief tenure as BMW’s board member for sales, Lutz fulfilled those expectations handily, fostering the creation of enthusiast-oriented cars like the 2002 turbo and 3.0 CSL, and by founding BMW Motorsport to put BMW back on the racetrack with a full-factory team.

In addition to being a car guy, the Swiss-born American is also a businessman, one who earned an MBA at the University of California-Berkeley while also flying jets with the US Marine Corps Reserve. Upon completing his service in 1964, Lutz took a job with Adam Opel AG, the General Motors subsidiary based in Germany. He spent eight years at Opel, and he’d advanced to its board of directors when he was recruited to the top sales job at BMW.

Lutz was just 39 years old when he was named BMW’s board member for sales and marketing. When he took his post on [ADDRESS], 1972, he joined a board chaired by 42-year-old Eberhard von Kuenheim, with whom he’d work closely to modernize the company.

Shortly after his arrival in Munich, Lutz began examining the contracts between BMW and its distributors. “In Germany, we were distributing cars directly to dealers, but we still had private importers and distributors in every major European country,” Lutz said in 2015. “The big distributors like Thodorof in France and Luigi Sodi in Italy got a distributor price way below the German dealer price, and since many of them had their own retail operations they had another margin. I showed von Kuenheim the profit and loss statements of the six largest European distributors, and their profit on 35,000 cars was higher than BMW AG’s for selling 200,000 cars.” [Note: BMW produced 164,701 cars in 1971, and 182,858 cars in 1972.]

In the US, the situation was much the same with respect to the balance sheet. The legal situation was far different, however. It took less than a year for Lutz and von Kuenheim to replace Thodorof with BMW’s first wholly-owned sales subsidiary, BMW France SA, and barely another year to do the same in Belgium and Italy. Where European law favored manufacturers over dealers and distributors, US law reversed that relationship, a disadvantage that BMW had compounded with its own distribution contracts.

Despite a disastrous engagement with Max Hoffman in the 1950s—which had ended with BMW facing bankruptcy thanks in no small part to Hoffman’s failure to fulfill his ordering and payment contracts—BMW re-established its relationship with the Vienna-born distributor in 1962. By then, Hoffman had lost nearly all of his other franchises, and BMW’s new sales chief, Paul Hahnemann, had thrown him a lifeline in the form of an arrangement that was mutually beneficial, in all likelihood.

Hahnemann was an effective salesman with a keen sense of product planning, but he was later revealed to be deeply corrupt. Upon taking over as BMW board chairman in 1970, von Kuenheim had ordered an internal audit that showed Hahnemann profiting personally—to the tune of at least one million dollars, and probably far more—by routing BMW’s advertising and printing contracts through his mistress, and at vastly inflated prices to boot.

On [ADDRESS], 1971, Hahnemann was forced out of BMW. By then, he’d already renewed the original three-year contract with Hoffman, rewriting it in 1963 to run through 1970. He’d done so again in 1967, granting Hoffman sole US rights even though BMW had lost $6.75 million on its 1966 exports to this market. And then, in 1970, Hahnemann had awarded Hoffman a new contract that ran all the way to 1982. Worse, he’d stripped the contract of the typical provision stating that the franchise remained the property of the manufacturer and couldn’t be transferred without prior consent.

Bob Lutz (right) visits the BMW Stand at the 2002 Detroit Auto Show and speaks with BMW Group Chairman Helmut Panke (2nd from left) and BMW NA CEO Tom Purvis (3rd from left).

At a 1972 board meeting, Lutz said such a contract was “highly unusual, to say the least.” Even more ominously, he noted, “Unfortunately, and for reasons that are obscure, our former director of sales acceded to Hoffman’s request to strike this provision of the contract. Export

manager Hermann Winkler objected; the contract was later modified to remove his objection. [It was] signed by Hahnemann over the protest of the legal department and Mr. Winkler.”

It didn’t take long for Hoffman to realize that Lutz wanted to replace the Hoffman Motors Corporation with a wholly-owned sales subsidiary, just as Mercedes, Volkswagen, and the other European marques had done in previous decades. Rather than acquiesce, Hoffman tried to enlist Lutz to carry on much as Hahnemann had done.

“Maxie offered me a substantial amount of money if I would stop trying to take the distributorship away from him,” Lutz said in 2015. Imitating Hoffman’s Viennese accent, Lutz recalled the distributor asking, “‘How much money do you make? You’re a nice young man. You’re very smart. I want to see you do well. I don’t think they’re paying you enough.’ I said, ‘Believe me, Maxie, I’m very satisfied with my financial arrangements.’ He said, ‘Ah, but I could make you so rich! If you’d cooperate with me, I could make you so rich!’ ‘I don’t want to hear it, Maxie.’”

Later, Hoffman told Lutz that he sold a lot of cars to Italian customers, with whom he was very friendly and who’d be angry if Lutz interfered with Hoffman’s business. “I said, ‘Maxie, come out and say it: If I keep trying to take the distributorship from you, you’re going to have me rubbed out,’” Lutz said. “He said, ’No, no, it’s only if there should be some unfortunate accident…’ It was like a bad movie.”

On [ADDRESS], 1972, BMW engaged a Washington, DC law firm, Galland Kharasch Calkins & Brown. One of the firm’s partners, George Galland, was a BMW owner himself, having had two Bavarias and a 2002. All of his cars had needed warranty repairs and parts that Hoffman refused to authorize. “Mine was not a unique experience,” Galland noted. Indeed, Galland’s problems mirrored those that BMW’s own investigations had unearthed.

As such issues affected BMW’s reputation in the US, the company tried to work with Hoffman to improve the situation. Needless to say, Hoffman resisted attempts to meddle with his business, even when it would have resulted in additional sales.

In 1971, with the 2002 in its fourth year of production, BMW had projected US sales opportunities of 40-50,000 cars per year; Hoffman sold 13,560. Two years later, BMW’s US export manager Karl Gerlinger reported that Hoffman was still selling far fewer cars than the market likely demanded. Although BMW’s exports to this market had risen to 15,113 cars in 1972, they fell to 13,789 in 1973 even though the 2002 was more popular than ever and car sales overall were increasing in the US. With so few cars coming in, customers faced long waits to get 2002s, and they couldn’t get a 1602 (as the 1600-2 had been renamed in 1971) as a stopgap since Hoffman had ceased to import the lower-powered model. He’d also declined to import the hatchback Touring, disliking its looks and being reluctant to carry the additional spare parts that another model would have required. Hoffman had long had an aversion to stocking spare parts, and in February 1974 he tried to convince BMW to take over this part of the business. When Lutz agreed to make a formal offer, Hoffman backed out.

That spring, as Lutz attempted to help Hoffman streamline his ordering and distribution process, Hoffman refused an allotment of cars, then agreed to accept the vehicles following a private meeting with von Kuenheim in New York. Two days later, he reneged, this time threatening to cancel his allotments for June and July 1974.

At the home plant in Munich, Hoffman’s erratic ordering “left employees not just disappointed but bitter, leading to layoffs, part-time work, and insecurity for the workers,” according to BMW works council representative Kurt Golda, who reported the situation to majority shareholder Herbert Quandt.

Quandt advised von Kuenheim to resolve “the burdens that now arise from the contract with Hoffman.”

On [ADDRESS], 1974 BMW issued a notice of termination of its agreement with Hoffman, citing “serious commercial reasons.” Hoffman would not go quietly, however, and it would take nearly a year before BMW of North America took over US operations from its longtime distributor.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Munich. At the beginning of the year, BMW M Motorsport launched the BMW M Racing Academy, a new customer sport support programme for four drivers from the GT4-category. The "Class of 2025," consisting of Berkay Besler (TUR), Nerea Martí (ESP), Matt Million (USA), and Niels Tröger (GER), has experienced an eventful first half of the year. The participants completed many valuable test kilometres in the BMW M2 Racing, trained at Formula Medicine, and received exclusive and detailed insights during BMW M Motorsport works engagements.

At the start of the programme, participants travelled to Formula Medicine in Viareggio (ITA), where they worked on their mental and physical fitness under the professional guidance of Dr. Riccardo Ceccarelli and his globally renowned team.

During various test drives with the BMW M2 Racing at Miramas (FRA) and Varano (ITA), the "Class of 2025" did not just accumulate many kilometres over the past months. Side by side with BMW M works drivers, participants contributed important development work for the new entry-level model which will be used by many private customer teams on the racetrack starting in 2026. They learned about the professional processes underlying the market launch of a new vehicle at a major manufacturer like BMW.

Martí and Besler gained extensive insights into BMW M Motorsport's works engagements during the FIA WEC race weekend at Imola (ITA). They exchanged ideas with BMW M Motorsport director Andreas Roos and BMW M works drivers, received a garage tour, and participated in a debrief. Million attended the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship race weekend at Laguna Seca (USA), observing the teams and drivers from the LMDh and GT3 programmes.

The BMW M Racing Academy is enriched by a quartet of mentors who fully support participants with advice, tips, and analyses. BMW M works driver Jens Klingmann (GER) serves as the main contact for the four young talents. He is supported by his works driver colleagues Max Hesse (GER) and Robby Foley (USA). All three accompany the programme closely and support participants with their expertise on and off the track. Dirk Adorf (GER) also contributes his extensive experience from previous talent support programmes. This support includes visits to "Class of 2025" race events in the second half of the year, providing insights into works programmes and advising them on their own GT4 customer sport engagements.

Besler, Martí, Tröger, and Million prevailed against several other drivers from the GT4-category in a comprehensive selection process in Munich (GER) at the end of last year.

Statements on the BMW M Racing Academy.

Björn Lellmann, Head of Customer Racing at BMW M Motorsport: "I am very pleased that we can offer a support programme again this season. Supporting young talents from customer racing is very important to BMW M Motorsport and me personally. It's great to see how well our 'Class of 2025' has developed in the first months and how much they appreciate our efforts to advance their development as drivers through involvement in works engagements. What they learn with us is intended to elevate them to a higher level for their current and future racing engagements. It was also very positive for us that the drivers were available for our BMW M2 Racing tests. All parties involved have benefitted enormously from that. Now I look forward to the second half of the year with the BMW M Racing Academy."

Jens Klingmann, BMW M Motorsport Works Driver: "We have had an exciting and thrilling first half-year, experiencing many things together in a short time. With the development days in the BMW M2 Racing, we created a special added value. We were able to involve our participants everywhere and offer them a behind-the-scenes look at how development tests are conducted and what is important in vehicle development. They received a lot of driving time in this project and made a very valuable contribution, which was very important for their development. Particularly significant is the experience of providing feedback to engineers and articulating the driving experience to create added value for everyone involved in the project - and to improve the car. We mentors are very glad to be involved, sharing our expertise on and off the track. We are always available to participants with tips, experiences, and advice. Overall, we have seen significant improvements on and off the track. I can draw a very positive balance from the first half-year and look forward to the second half."

Berkay Besler, BMW M Racing Academy Participant: “The programme has been great so far. Up until now we have experienced a lot of things, most importantly what BMW M Motorsport expects from us. Being one of the fastest on track is really important but also it is important how we behave off the track and represent the brand. Being a part of the BMW M Racing Academy is a great opportunity for us to learn as much as possible from all the mentors. We have spent a lot of time with them and they are all trying to help us and want us to learn as much as possible to be a better race car driver. I am really happy for that and really appreciate that. We have so many more things to do in our programme so we are all looking forward and can’t wait to be back.“

Nerea Martí, BMW M Racing Academy Participant: "The experience so far has been incredible. From day one, I have learned so much - not only on the track but also in terms of teamwork and approaching motorsport in a more professional way. We had intense physical and mental tests that showed me where I can improve and that small changes in training or mindset can make a huge difference. One of the most valuable parts of the programme were the on-track test sessions with the BMW M2 Racing. It was special to learn how to work together as a team to analyse performance and develop the car. The mentors play a big role in this. They share their experience with us and help us understand how to give clear, structured feedback and communicate during a debrief. I really appreciate how open and honest they are with us."

Matt Million, BMW M Racing Academy Participant: "I am very happy that the opportunity arose to be part of such a programme. The ties to the brand have helped me feel even more integrated in the processes of BMW M Motorsport. I have been able to take in the level of professionalism at which BMW M Motorsport, the employees, and the drivers work and have benefitted from it in all areas. Working with BMW M Motorsport engineers during the BMW M2 Racing test drive was super valuable. It has significantly improved my ability to analyse or write reports; It has helped me immensely in terms of communication. The behind-the-scenes look at Laguna Seca gave me a better insight into how BMW M Motorsport works on-site. The mentors are incredibly helpful. They have given me fantastic input on what their roles look like - not only within their teams but also as BMW M works drivers. I plan to spend even more time with them this year."

Niels Tröger, BMW M Racing Academy Participant: "I have been able to gather a lot of impressions about what the work of a works driver entails. For example, how important it is to provide engineers with good feedback to improve or develop the car. At Formula Medicine, I gained many important insights that a works driver receives in his work. I was able to focus on where my weaknesses are, but also where my strengths lie. I can now work on that further. As a driver, I am getting faster because the BMW M Racing Academy gives me the opportunity to spend a lot of time in the car and test. A big part is the mentors, who work very well with us and whom we can contact at any time. Overall, the BMW M Racing Academy is a great opportunity to develop my career and achieve success together with BMW M Motorsport."

Munich. At the 24 Hours of Nürburgring (GER) on 21st/22nd June 2025, the BMW M2 Racing will complete its final major endurance test before the sales launch, with a high-profile driver lineup. Belgian drivers Ugo de Wilde and Charles Weerts, along with German driver Jens Klingmann – who has been involved in the testing and development of the vehicle from the very beginning – will take the wheel as a trio of BMW M works drivers in the cockpit of the new entry-level model from BMW M Motorsport. They will be joined by experienced Nürburgring racer and motorsport journalist Michael Bräutigam (GER). The car will be fielded by FK Performance Motorsport.

Media guide with all information on the BMW M2 Racing: [EXTERNAL_RESOURCE] .

The BMW M2 Racing has already completed more than 30,000 test kilometres and will be available to BMW M Motorsport customer teams as the ideal entry-level race car from the 2026 season. In this final major test, the car will compete in the SP3T class and be put through its paces by the drivers and team under the extreme conditions of an endurance race. Klingmann has been actively involved in every stage of the BMW M2 Racing’s development and has played a key role in preparing the car for launch. De Wilde recently earned his Nordschleife permit and will make his 24-hour race debut. Weerts finished third overall in 2024 and now trades his GT3 seat for valuable test duties with BMW M Motorsport. Bräutigam has driven many race cars and will bring a journalistic perspective to the BMW M2 Racing thanks to his extensive experience. FK Performance Motorsport oversaw the car’s debut at the first test race in the 2024 Nürburgring Endurance Series and will manage it again during the Qualifiers and the 24h race in 2025. At the Qualifiers this coming weekend, Weerts, de Wilde, and Bräutigam will take turns at the wheel, with Klingmann joining for the 24-hour race.

Björn Lellmann (Head of Customer Racing at BMW M Motorsport): “With the 24-hour race at the Nürburgring, the intensive test and development phase of our new entry-level car, the BMW M2 Racing, comes to an end. For one final time, our works drivers will collect data and impressions to help us deliver a car to our customers that is as well-prepared as possible. The Eifel endurance race is the ultimate test of strength. I’m delighted that we can also give the media the exclusive opportunity to experience the car’s performance firsthand.”

Ugo de Wilde: “I can’t wait to be there. I did my permit on the Nordschleife this year and I really love the track. It is an amazing circuit and the atmosphere around there was already fantastic in NLS so I can’t wait to discover the 24–hour race and to compete there with the brand new BMW M2 Racing. It’s really excting; I’ve heard really good comments from Charles and the other drivers who opportunity to test it already.”

Jens Klingmann: “[ADDRESS] Hours of Nürburgring marks the final major dress rehearsal for our BMW M2 Racing. We’ve completed a long and intensive testing and development phase and have covered a lot of kilometres. Now we’re especially looking forward to putting the car through its paces once more in race conditions, to ensure we can hand over a perfectly developed BMW M2 Racing to our customers. I believe we are very well prepared. We’ve simulated every scenario for all areas of use – whether on the Nordschleife, in other championships, or for track days. Of course, things are always a bit different in real race conditions. For example, you see how driver changes go, or whether everything is finalised on the software side. So this is truly the final big test before production begins.”

Charles Weerts: “I can’t wait to be at the Nordschleife for a legendary race, the 24 hours. I’ve got lucky enough to be driving their last year with the BMW M4 GT3, with Max Hesse and Dan Harper, and we finished third on our first attempt together which is definitely a nice memory. This year we come back with a different approach and different goals. I will be sharing duties with Jens Klingmann, Ugo de Wilde and Michael Bräutigam in the new BMW M2 Racing where we will do our best for BMW M Motorsport to optimally develop this car for the customer in 2026. I am very much looking forward to see how this car will handle in the ‘Green Hell’ and can’t wait to be there again.”

+++ Eagles for Education enters its second year at the BMW PGA Championship – BMW Group donates £1,000 per eagle to the Golf Foundation +++ Unleash Your Drive strengthens mental resilience in pupils through golf +++ Fans can also support the Official Charity of the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth Club +++

London. From today until Sunday, a world-class field will compete at the flagship event of the DP World Tour for one of Europe’s most prestigious titles. On the road to victory at the BMW PGA Championship, every eagle is particularly valuable – defending champion Billy Horschel (USA), for example, defeated Rory McIlroy in a playoff at the 18th hole in 2024 with an eagle. But beyond the sporting outcome, eagles have a significant impact. As in the previous year, the BMW Group is supporting the Golf Foundation through its Eagles for Education initiative by donating £1,000 per eagle scored, thereby contributing to the Unleash Your Drive programme.

Unleash Your Drive brings simplified versions of golf to schools across England, aiming to strengthen mental toughness. Pupils are taught to remain resilient, focused, and determined in the face of challenges, setbacks, and pressure, while maintaining a positive and determined mindset. These skills, which can be ideally practiced through golf, will help to prepare youngsters for life inside and outside the classroom.

The goals of the programme align perfectly with those of the Eagles for Education initiative, through which the BMW Group fulfils its social responsibility at international BMW golf tournaments. Together with local organisations, it advocates for education and equal opportunities for young people facing challenging starting conditions.

The collaboration with the Golf Foundation started last year. At the 2024 BMW PGA Championship, pros scored a total of 89 eagles. Winkfield St Mary’s School in Bracknell was one of the many schools who benefitted from the BMW Group’s donation of £89,000. As another week of Eagles for Education began on Monday, Nick Dougherty, former professional golfer, winner of the 2009 BMW International Open, and President of the Golf Foundation, joined a session with the youngsters and caught up with the teachers who have seen the impact on the ground. He also invited the children to the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth Club.

As the Golf Foundation is also the Official Tournament Charity this year, visitors can contribute to the good cause as well. Alongside Eagles for Education, this year will see the Golf Foundation run the Mega Putt as well as chipping and simulator challenges across the Championship Village in order to raise vital funds. Every £10 raised gets another pupil on the Unleash Your Drive programme, which sees six weeks of golf delivered that focuses on vital mental toughness tools.

Through its Eagles for Education initiative, the BMW Group is also involved in the BMW International Open (Germany) in support of the Philipp Lahm Foundation for Sport and Education. As part of the global amateur tournament series BMW Golf Cup, the Eagles for Education initiative supports JOBLINGE in Germany and UNICEF at the World Final. All proceeds from the BMW Championship (USA) benefit the Evans Scholars Foundation, which awards full tuition and housing college scholarships for deserving caddies.

Assen. For BMW Motorrad Motorsport and the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team, the FIM Superbike World Championship round at Assen (NED) was an eventful weekend highlighted by an outstanding victory from Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR) in the Superpole Race and valuable points for the championship standings. “El Turco” won the Sunday morning sprint on his BMW M 1000 RR with a commanding lead, celebrating his first-ever rain victory in WorldSBK. His teammate and local hero Michael van der Mark (NED) put on a sensational charge in the sprint race, fighting his way from 13th on the grid to finish fifth. In the two main races, however, both riders struggled with issues. Razgatlioglu had to settle for fourth and eighth places, while van der Mark came home ninth and seventeenth. Despite that, Razgatlioglu, second overall in the standings, managed to reduce his deficit to championship leader Nicolò Bulega (ITA), who failed to score points on Sunday due to technical issues. The fourth round of the 2025 WorldSBK season will take place in three weeks’ time (2nd to 4th May) in Cremona, Italy.

Reactions after the Assen round:

Sven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “It was a weekend of great highs, but also of tough setbacks. I think we need to stay positive and look ahead. We’re still at the beginning of the season. We showed in the Superpole Race that we are fundamentally capable of winning, but our overall package isn’t yet at the level where we can perform consistently. Toprak and Mickey both did a great job, especially under mixed conditions. The sprint race was really impressive, and I believe it gave us a real energy boost. On the other hand, the second main race in particular showed us that there’s still a lot of work to do. We now need to use the time until Cremona to take the next step. I’m confident that although the team had a tough afternoon today, we’ll push hard again tomorrow to prepare for Cremona.”

Toprak Razgatlioglu, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “In the Superpole Race in wet conditions I felt very good on the bike and the grip also seemed to be not bad. It was special because it was also my first win in my WorldSBK career in wet conditions. That makes me very happy. For race two in dry conditions we tried a different setup but it was still not working. Yesterday, we had a very big drop on the rear tyre, so this time we used the standard SC0 tyre but it started to get blisters on the right side. It was not easy to ride the bike. For some laps I thought if it would be better to enter the box but I also thought about the points so I just tried to get the best possible position, and then I also saw that Nicolò Bulega’s bike was stopping in the first corner. I am not happy for this, even if it was good for me as I am now 21 points behind him. But the season is very long and we have still many races to go. I just focus on my job and hope we come back stronger because we need to improve the bike and to fight again for the win. Now we are going to Cremona. Last year I was just riding there for one day during the test. I did 40 or 50 laps, not more. I missed the races there, I just watched them on TV so I don’t know what to expect there. I will just try to do my best again and hope we will find a good setup immediately.”

Michael van der Mark, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “The weekend started off alright on Friday. I was able to improve here and there and was quite happy with the bike. Then on Saturday, we had an issue in the morning so we stayed in in FP3. In Superpole, I felt good but I was not fast enough. In yesterday’s race, coming from P13, I had a good start and really enjoyed the first half of the race but then had a massive drop in the tyres and just stumbled back. In the end, I finished ninth, which wasn’t bad but also not fantastic. This morning’s Superpole Race was in wet conditions with the track drying. I was looking forward to it and to use my experience. I had a good start and a really enjoyable race. I made a mistake and ran off track in a big battle and finished fifth. That was quite positive and I enjoyed it. I wish I could have been on the podium in the Superpole Race but I just messed it up a little bit. I then had a good starting position for race two. Another good start, but I just didn’t have the right feeling with the grip. I tried to stay with the group for a long time but then I made a mistake. So I pushed to stay with the other group but for some reason there was no performance in the bike in the afternoon. So we have to find out what we can do, because we need to change this.”

Woodcliff Lake, N.J. – Jan. 23, 2025 – The Ultimate Driving Machine® is alive and well in 2025 as BMW of North America celebrates the company’s 50 th anniversary. Continuing its motorsport legacy, the year begins at Daytona International Speedway and the [ADDRESS] At Daytona weekend.

The BMW M Endurance Challenge for the IMSA Michelin Pilot Challenge will start the weekend off on Friday before the 63 rd annual twice-around-the-clock endurance race enters into the record books.

Bobby Rahal, BMW M Team RLL team principal, and only one of two men who has won the [ADDRESS] At Daytona as a driver (1981), team owner (2019, 2020), and father (Graham, 2011) will serve as the race’s Grand Marshall. Dirk Häcker, Head of Development BMW M GmbH, will be in the flag stand to wave the green flag to start the four-hour race. Every current M vehicle sold today was developed under his watch.

The 2025 BMW M Endurance Challenge, the first Michelin Pilot Challenge event of the year, will feature four BMW M4 GT4 racing cars on the entry list – three of them the new-for-2025 BMW M4 GT4 EVO – among three BMW Customer Racing teams. Turner Motorsport, the 2024 BMW Sport Trophy Team champions, will line up two of the new EVOs, the No. 95 car for Francis Selldorf and Dillon Machavern, and the No. 96 for Vincent Barletta, Matt Dalton, and Patrick Gallagher. Auto Technic Racing will enter the third EVO, the No. 27 for Roland Krainz, Austin Krainz, and Stephen McAleer. Sean McAlister and Jeff Westphal will drive the No. 39 CarBahn with Peregrine Racing BMW M4.

A 2025 BMW M5 will pace the event as the race’s official Safety Car.

During last weekend’s Roar Before the [ADDRESS] test, the VP Sports Car Challenge held its first two rounds. Saturday’s 45-minute sprint saw Patrick Wilmot race the No. 12 Swish Motorsports BMW M4 GT4 to a third place finish in the GSX class. The new-for-2025 GTDX class saw Samantha Tan finish fifth in her No. 38 ST Racing BMW M4 GT3. Vincent Barletta, driving the No. 95 Turner Motorsport BMW M4 GT3, finished sixth. Sunday’s sprint was held under decidedly different conditions, the Chamber of Commerce seemingly past due on its favorable Florida weather payment. Tan and Barletta equaled their Saturday efforts in the GTDX class while Wilmot finished seventh, the top-finishing BMW in the GSX class.

# BMW NA 50th Anniversary | 50 Stories for 50 Years [ADDRESS]: “BMW M Achieves Wide Appeal: Unique E36 M3 Models for the U.S.”
## January 1996, BMW NA imported 1,705 automatic M3s. In Canada, meanwhile, the 45 enthusiasts who had pre-ordered their cars took delivery of the Euro-spec M3 in early 1994. After a hiatus year for Model Year 1995, the U.S.-spec E36 M3 would be offered to Canadian customers from Model Year 1996.
Date: 2025-04-28 | Author: Thomas Plucinsky BMW Group | ID: T0449845EN_US
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The American automobile market loves high performance, and it also loves low prices. That paradox presents a challenge for any automaker, but it’s not insurmountable. All it takes is a willingness to adapt, and some creative engineering, as evidenced by the E36 M3 that arrived on these shores in 1995.

BMW M began developing the E36 M3 in 1989, two years before the launch of the series-production E36 3 Series coupe that would form the basis for this high-performance variant. The first-generation E30 M3 was still in production, and still winning races, but BMW M wanted to evolve the model from a pure homologation special into a high-performance road car that could nonetheless compete successfully in the Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft, or DTM.

Naturally, the requirements of racing were taken into consideration during the E36 M3’s development, and the new car’s S50 six-cylinder engine was a technological masterpiece. Designed under the engineering leadership of Paul Rosche, the engine used a two-piece head with four valves per cylinder, shim-under-bucket valve adjustment, step-free VANOS variable timing on the intake camshaft, and six individual throttle bodies. [ADDRESS],990cc, and with a compression ratio of 10.8:1, the S50B30 delivered 286 horsepower at 7,000 rpm and 236 pound-feet of torque at 3,600 rpm, enough to propel the car from zero to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 6.0 seconds. The rest of the car was similarly sophisticated, with stylish aero enhancements by Ulf Wiedhase and Christine Angermann and 17-inch M Double Spoke alloy wheels by Marcus Syring.

Thanks in large part to its exotic engine, the E36 M3 was set to be significantly more expensive than the outgoing E30 M3, which had sold for DM 59,800 when it launched in Europe in 1986. In its second generation, the M3 was expected to cost another DM 20,000, about $11,000 more at the highly variable exchange rate of the late 1980s. For the U.S. market, where BMW NA had struggled to sell the $35,000 E30 M3 in the latter stages of its production run, the new M3 was deemed too expensive.

“I had to be the Lone Ranger in the desert, pointing out to everyone the pricing problems we had with our brand in the U.S.,” said Carl Flesher, then BMW of North America’s VP of Marketing under president Karl Gerlinger. “That, as nice as that car would be, it would be too much money, and no one would see the value and we would have trouble selling it. I said there was no reason in the world to bring a car like that in and then find ourselves having to discount it.”

At that point, none of the M3’s details had been released for public consumption, and it was considered highly confidential within BMW even when the M3’s details were released internally in late April 1992, in a confidential “Pre-Information” document. In June, an even more detailed document was distributed to product planning departments for their assessment, but again this information was not yet made public.

That said, good journalists always cultivate confidential sources, and the BMW Car Club of America had a very good journalist in Bob Roemer. Roemer had spent time in Germany with the U.S. Army, and he’d made friends with a number of BMW insiders. That included Karlheinz Kalbfell, then head of BMW M. (Both men had served as tank commanders, which undoubtedly created a bond that went well beyond their mutual enthusiasm for BMW.) In early January 1992, Roemer spoke with Kalbfell at the Detroit Auto Show, and he reported in Roundel magazine’s March 1992 issue that BMW was “considering not bringing the new M3 to North America and letting the entire M-car concept die here when the current [E34] M5 is replaced.” (M cars had struggled in this market throughout the 1980s, saddled with high prices and oversupplied relative to demand. BMW NA had sold just 1,678 examples of the E34 M5 from December 1989 through April 1993 and had struggled to move the last thousand or so of the 5,300 E30 M3s imported from March 1987 through December 1990.)

At Kalbfell’s request, or at least with his consent, Roemer asked Roundel readers to submit their thoughts on the matter, and he published excerpts from their letters in the magazine’s July 1992 issue. In closing that article, Roemer mentioned that he had presented the letters to Karl Gerlinger, then president of BMW NA, “so that he and his staff could have the full impact of your communications.”

Those communications were thoughtful, and highly detailed. CCA members deemed M cars essential to BMW’s identity as a high-performance marque, but felt the M cars hadn’t been advertised sufficiently. As for what they wanted in an M3, readers specified six-second 0-to-60 acceleration, great handling and brakes, and decent amenities, including leather upholstery on sport seats, air conditioning, and a radio. For that, they’d be willing to pay $35,000, and they thought most of their fellow club members would do the same.

In September 1992, the E36 M3 made its world premiere at the Paris Auto Salon, creating plenty of buzz among enthusiasts worldwide. The car went on sale that month, with its German-market price starting at DM 80,000, or $51,000 at the 1992 exchange rate.

That was far more than U.S. enthusiasts had said they’d be willing to pay, which caused BMW NA executives—led by Gerlinger as president, joined since April 1992 by Victor Doolan, who’d replaced Flesher as VP of Marketing and with additional responsibility for sales—to formally reject the car for the U.S. market following Kalbfell’s M Product Strategy presentation in Woodcliff Lake on [ADDRESS]-12, 1992.

BMW Canada, on the other hand, agreed to take the car. In February 1993, BMW Canada’s head of Product Planning, Tom Plucinsky (later head of Product Communications for BMW NA) calculated an initial market capacity of 50 E36 M3s, followed by 75 in the second year and a final 30 cars in year three. He requested a show car for the Canadian International Autoshow in Toronto later that month, which generated a brief article by Canadian journalist Jeremy Sinek in Autoweek on [ADDRESS], 1993. Sinek’s article created considerable consternation among U.S. enthusiasts who’d just found out they’d be denied the M3 their Canadian counterparts would enjoy. It also generated consternation within BMW of North America, which was outraged at the negative publicity surrounding the decision. NA quickly hit reverse, and at the end of March 1993 the company formally agreed with BMW M’s suggestion to explore an alternate powertrain that would allow the E36 M3 to be sold affordably in the U.S.

Things moved quickly after that. Kalbfell and Rosche had been developing a version of the series-production M50 six-cylinder engine for South Africa, where BMW had offered several parts-bin hot rods, and where Doolan had worked prior to taking positions at BMW Canada and North America. One of those SA specials was the 332, an E30 3 Series powered by the M30 “big six” that had been in production since 1968 and was soon to be retired. A new engine would be needed if South Africa were to offer a similar car on the E36 platform, hence the development of a hotter M50.

When the modified M50 was up and running, Kalbfell and Rosche demonstrated it to Doolan in Munich. “They drove me to a restaurant in a 5 Series with an M-modified motor they thought could work in an M3 for us,” Doolan said. “Who was I to disagree?”

Automobile magazine put a Dakar Yellow M3 on the cover of its May 1993 issue, above a headline that read “New BMW M3: 286 hp, 155 mph—and it’s coming to America!” The horsepower figure and top speed reflected the specs of the European car, but the M3 was indeed coming to America.

To keep the car’s price within reach of American wallets, the modified M50 would be far simpler and less expensive than the S50. It had a one-piece cylinder head, self-adjusting valve tappets, and a single throttle body instead of six. With a slightly lower compression ratio of 10.5:1, the engine would be less sensitive to octane levels in fuel, a crucial consideration in the U.S. The engine delivered 240 hp at 6,000 rpm and 225 pound-feet at 4,250 rpm—enough to satisfy enthusiasts’ demands for robust 0–to-60 mph acceleration, but not enough to place the car in the most expensive insurance category, which the Euro M3 occupied in Germany. Most importantly, the lower-spec engine would reduce the car’s retail price to $35,800, almost exactly what enthusiasts had said they’d be willing to pay.

“The Germans thought it was heresy to dumb-down a new M product for the U.S., but the difference was 0.2 second from 0 to 60,” said Erik Wensberg, then BMW of North America’s Motorsport Manager.

Because the engine wasn’t considered a “real” M engine within the M division, BMW of North America was encouraged to identify the car as an M330i rather than an M3. BMW NA won that battle, and by August 1993 the U.S.-spec E36 M3 had been defined. On [ADDRESS], the launch date was set for [ADDRESS], when a select group of U.S. journalists including Bob Roemer would drive prototypes of the car at the Nürburgring.

In March 1994, series production of the U.S.-spec M3 coupe began, and the car was an immediate hit upon its arrival in the U.S. Other than the engine, now designated as S50B30US, the U.S.-spec E36 M3 was nearly identical to its European counterpart, albeit with solid rather than floating front brake rotors, an instrument cluster whose speedometer read in miles per hour rather than kilometers, a tach that indicated a graduated redline, and a fuel economy meter in place of the oil temperature gauge. For the U.S., air conditioning and an Alpine sound system were standard, with the customer’s choice of M cloth/Amaretta suede or Nappa leather upholstery as no-cost options. To accommodate the rougher roads in this country, the M3’s suspension would use slightly softer spring and damper rates than its European counterpart.

By the end of 1995, BMW of North America had sold 8,515 examples, a number that compared favorably with the 11,284 European-spec cars produced from September 1992 through July 1995. Sales were so strong, in fact, that BMW of North America convinced M to offer the M3 with an optional five-speed automatic transmission. From December 1994 to January 1996, BMW NA imported 1,705 automatic M3s. In Canada, meanwhile, the 45 enthusiasts who had pre-ordered their cars took delivery of the Euro-spec M3 in early 1994. After a hiatus year for Model Year 1995, the U.S.-spec E36 M3 would be offered to Canadian customers from Model Year 1996.

Those totals were only the beginning. The M3 came in for major revisions in 1996, getting a larger-displacement, more powerful engine worldwide. In the U.S., the S50B30US was replaced by the S52B32US; based on the new M52 six, this engine displaced 3,201cc and delivered the same 240 horsepower and slightly more torque: 236 pound-feet instead of 225.

Along with the new engine, the 1996 M3 was available in the U.S. as a four-door sedan, that was exclusive to this market, and which proved tremendously popular. It was followed by a U.S.-only convertible in 1998. In the U.S., all three body styles would be available with a five-speed manual or automatic transmission, though U.S. enthusiasts were denied the new six-speed manual and the Sequential Manual Gearbox offered in Europe. Even so, BMW NA sold an additional 27,084 M3s before production ended in August 1999, bringing the total to 35,843 cars. That was an astonishing figure, and it represented fully one-third of all M3s produced. The success of the M3 turned the U.S. from a marginal M-car market to the world’s largest and most important by 1995—an accolade it holds to this day. “We showed that at the right price point, the M3 could be wildly successful in the U.S.,” Brekus said.

“Regardless of your position on the purity of the U.S. M3, there is no doubt that the reputation and volume of the U.S. E36 M3 did wonders to establish BMW M in North America, while providing BMW M with the cash reserves needed to develop the incredible E46 M3 that followed,” Plucinsky said.

The E36 M3 itself had met enthusiast demands, and its performance credentials were solidified by a racing program organized by Wensberg as Motorsport Manager—and M Brand Manager, starting in the fall of 1994. Following a development year in 1995, the M3s campaigned for BMW NA by Prototype Technology Group won the GT driver’s titles for Pete Halsmer and Bill Auberlen in 1996 and ’97, respectively, and the 1998 GT2 title for the team. In recognition of the BMW CCA’s role in bringing the E36 M3 to the U.S., the cars raced with BMW CCA stickers on their front splitters, and they’ve remained on every GT car raced by BMW NA since 1995. “The CCA letter-writing campaign started the whole ball rolling in the U.S.,” Wensberg said. “It’s really the club’s team.”

Munich. Attractive products, strong order volumes and strict cost discipline have ensured for the BMW Group a start to the year according to plan. The premium manufacturer from Munich continued its dynamic BEV ramp-up in a volatile and competitive environment, while delivering profitability at the upper end of its 2025 target range in the Automotive Segment. The BMW Group has thus once again confirmed the long-term viability of its strategy of technology openness.

In the first quarter of the year, the BMW Group delivered 586,117 premium vehicles to customers (-1.4%). More than a quarter of these were electrified ( 26.9% ), with fully-electric vehicles once again showing significant sales growth of +32.4% . The EBIT margin in the Automotive Segment – one of the company’s key profit indicators – stood at 6.9% , placing it at the upper end of the targeted range of 5-7% for the year.

“The more challenging the environment, the more crucial it is to have compelling products, a consistent strategy and a high degree of flexibility. Our technology-open approach remains a key success factor: with our young, highly attractive models and our broad range of drives, we are able to meet the various needs of customers worldwide. This enables us to achieve robust results and stay on course to meet our ambitious full-year targets,” said [EXECUTIVE_OFFICER], Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG . “With the NEUE KLASSE, we are putting our biggest future project on the road: we are expanding our fully-electric offering, and rolling out future technology clusters and the new design language across our entire model portfolio. This will raise the level of innovation in our vehicles across all drive types to a whole new level – while also setting the course for profitable growth and sustainable success.”

Significant increase in fully-electric vehicle deliveries

Despite persistently strong competition in China, the company's global deliveries remained largely in line with the previous year (-1.4%). In the first three months, the BMW Group achieved growth in key markets Europe (+6.2%) and the US (+4.0%).

In the first quarter of 2025, the BMW brand delivered a total of 520,121 vehicles to customers worldwide, surpassing the previous year’s volume in all regions except China. The strongest growth was recorded by the new BMW 5 Series models (+35.8%), as well as the BMW X1 and X2 variants (+31.8%).

The BMW M brand achieved solid sales growth of +5.0% in the first quarter, delivering a total of 50,500 vehicles to customers. The main growth drivers were the high-performance models BMW M3* and M3 Touring* as well as BMW M5* and BMW M5 touring*, which were in high demand across all regions.

The MINI brand, which updated its entire product range over the course of last year, sold 64,615 units worldwide – an increase of 4.1%. The Rolls-Royce brand delivered 1,381 units to customers between January and March (-9.4%).

Fully-electric vehicles from the BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce brands reported significant growth, with 109,513 deliveries worldwide (+32.4%). The BMW iX1* was the brand’s most successful BEV model, while the BMW i4* accounted for half of all BMW 4 Series delivered.

Sales of fully-electric vehicles saw the strongest growth in Europe (+64.2%). New models from the MINI brand were major contributors to this: The urban premium brand delivered a total of 22,794 fully-electric vehicles, achieving a BEV share of 35.3% .

The BMW Group currently offers at least one model with an electrified drive train in every vehicle class. Total deliveries of electrified vehicles ( BEVs and PHEVs ) also rose significantly in the first three months of the year, reaching 157,487 vehicles (2024: 122,582 vehicles/+28.5%).

The BMW Group is successfully implementing its strategic plan to further expand e-mobility. Additionally, it will reach two significant sales milestones: first, the delivery of 1.5 million fully-electric premium vehicles since the market launch of the BMW i3 in 2013; and second, a total of three million electrified cars since then.

Group EBT margin at 9.2%

First-quarter Group revenues totalled € 33,758 million (2024: € 36,614 million/-7.8%; currency-adjusted: -8,7%). As previously announced, the BMW Group benefited from a moderate reduction in administrative and sales expenses. Compared with the previous year, sales revenues declined particularly in the highly competitive Chinese market, as expected.

Between January and March, the BMW Group reported pre-tax earnings (EBT) of € 3,113 million (2024: € 4,162 million/-25.2%).

The EBT margin for this period was 9.2% (2024: 11.4%). Group net profit for the first quarter totalled € 2,173 million (2024: € 2,951 million/-26.4%).

Automotive EBIT margin at upper end of full-year guidance

The Automotive Segment earned revenues of € 29,211 million (2024: € 30,939 million/-5.6%%).

The anti-subsidy tariffs on BEVs produced in China , introduced by the European Commission in October, increased the cost of sales, creating a headwind in the low three-digit million euro range, as forecast.

Earnings before financial result (EBIT) for the first quarter totalled € 2,024 million (2024: € 2,710 million/-25.3%). The EBIT margin came in at 6.9% (2024: 8.8%) and was thus at the high end of the target range of 5-7% for the year. Excluding depreciation and amortisation from the BBA purchase price allocation ,the EBIT margin for the first quarter was 8.1% .

The BMW Group is systematically leveraging innovations, focusing on efficient and low-emission technologies, as well as further electrification and digitalisation of both its product line-up and the company.

Based on the strength of its current operating performance, the BMW Group allocated € 1,984 million (2024: € 1,974 million/+0.5%) to research and development in the first quarter which was concentrated on electrification and digitalisation of the vehicle fleet across all model series.

The company also incurred R&D expenditure primarily for the future models of the NEUE KLASSE, such as the BMW iX3, and the successor models to the BMW X5 and BMW X7.

“The BMW Group stands for long-term growth, sustainable value creation and continued dependability for its stakeholders. Stable financial performance and effective cost management characterised the first quarter despite the challenging environment. We remain focused on improving our efficiency and optimising our cost structures,” said Walter Mertl, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Finance, at the quarterly conference call in Munich.

“Digitalisation and AI are contributing to this. Innovation and business benefits go hand in hand for us. We are also leveraging the proven flexibility of our network to address the current geopolitical challenges.”

Automotive Segment free cash flow at € 413 million

The free cash flow of the Automotive segment amounted to €413 million in the first quarter of 2025 (2024: €1,283 million). The decline compared to the previous year is primarily due to lower earnings before taxes, an expected higher consumption of provisions, and increased cash outflows from capital expenditures related to 31 December 2024 in the amount of €964 million.

Conversely, the seasonally typical but significantly lower increase in stock compared to the previous year led to the change in working capital of €65 million (2024: -€1,189 million).

From January to March, capital expenditure totaled €1,202 million (2024: €1,323 million/-9.1%). The capex ratio came in at 3.6% (2024: 3.6%).

The BMW Group is still targeting a free cash flow of > € 5 billion in the Automotive Segment for the full year.

Robust performance in Financial Services Segment

BMW Group Financial Services benefited from dynamic new leasing business in the first quarter of the year, with new leasing contracts up 12.7%. Overall, total new retail business was down slightly, compared to the previous year, with 402,811 new contracts concluded (-4.6%). The financing and leasing business for new vehicles remained at the previous year's level. Outside of China, new business was stable at a high level.

The volume of new business increased slightly, driven by higher financing volumes per vehicle across all financing and leasing contracts with retail customers, reaching € 15,988 million (2024: € 15,620 million/+2.4%).

The percentage of BMW Group new vehicles leased or financed by the Financial Services Segment reached 43.0% at the end of the first quarter (2024: 41.8%/+1.2 percentage points). In the three-month period, the segment reported pre-tax earnings of € 650 million (2024: € 730 million/-11.0%). Most notably, lower income from the resale of end-of-lease vehicles led to a year-on-year decrease in earnings, as the number of end-of-lease vehicles was lower than in the previous year. During the reporting period, the credit loss ratio remained at the low rate of 0.23% across the entire loan portfolio (2024: 0.21%).

BMW Motorrad with EBT margin of 9.4%

In the year to the end of March, BMW Motorrad delivered 44,609 motorcycles and scooters to customers (2024: 46,434 units; -3.9%). The segment EBIT margin of 9.4% (2024: 12.2%) was above the targeted range of 5.5-7.5% for the year.

BMW AG continues share repurchase programme

Following the authorisation granted by the Annual General Meeting of BMW AG on 11 May 2022, the company has acquired treasury shares. The shares from the initial repurchase programme have already been retired.

As of 31 March 2025, BMW AG holds 22,317,345 own shares from the second buy-back programme, corresponding to a nominal amount of €22,317,345.

Based on the authorisation granted at the Annual General Meeting of 11 May 2022, as of 31 March 2025, BMW AG had purchased shares equivalent to 7.27% of the share capital.

BMW Group confirms full-year guidance The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has revised its forecasts for global economic growth downwards to 2.8% in April 2025: Current trade conflicts and the associated potential rise in inflation, as well as uncertainty among businesses and consumers, could weigh on global growth.

According to sector forecasts, the global automotive markets are likely to see slight growth.

The BMW Group expects demand to rise in many markets in 2025, driven by a stabilizing inflation and further moderate interest rate cuts. In the USA, permanent tariffs could be reflected in rising inflation.

The guidance* published in the BMW Group Report 2024 in March 2025 includes all tariff increases that had taken effect by 12 March 2025. Due to the volatile developments and ongoing negotiations, the potential impact of tariffs in the current financial year can only be estimated, based on assumptions. The BMW Group expects some of the tariff increases to be temporary, with reductions from July 2025. The forecast also includes mitigating measures to offset the impact of higher tariffs.

Given the sustained demand for its attractive premium vehicles, the BMW Group is able to confirm its guidance for the year. The company anticipates slight sales growth, with fully-electric vehicles contributing to a slightly higher share of deliveries. Due to the factors mentioned above, Group earnings before tax are expected to be on a par with the previous year .**The EBIT margin for the Automotive Segment is forecast to be within the range of 5.0-7.0%, with an RoCE of between 9-13%.

In the Financial Services Segment, RoE is projected to be between 13-16%.

In the Motorcycles Segment , a slight increase in sales and an EBIT margin within the range of 5.5-7.5%are forecast, with an RoCE of 13-17%.

The above targets will be achieved with the current number of employees .

The BMW Group’s actual business performance may deviate from these projections – for example, due to changes in political and macroeconomic conditions. Risks to earnings could arise, for instance, from further tariff increases or tariffs remaining in place for longer than planned, potentially extending well into the second half of the year. The company continues to closely monitor macroeconomic developments.

Escalation of trade disputes could also lead to supply bottlenecks – for example, from import or export restrictions on specific parts or raw materials.

Deliveries to customers

A new or used vehicle is recorded as a delivery once it is handed over to the end user (which also includes leaseholders under lease contracts with BMW Financial Services). In the US and Canada, end users also include (1) dealers when they designate a vehicle as a service loaner or demonstrator vehicle and (2) dealers and other third parties when they purchase a company vehicle at auction and dealers when they purchase company vehicles directly from the BMW Group. Deliveries may be made by BMW AG, one of its international subsidiaries, a BMW Group retail outlet, or independent third-party dealers. The vast majority of deliveries – and hence the reporting of deliveries to the BMW Group – is made by independent third-party dealers. Retail vehicle deliveries during a given reporting period do not correlate directly to the revenues that the BMW Group recognises in respect of that particular reporting period.

Profit before financial result. Profit before financial result comprises revenues less cost of sales, less selling and administrative expenses and plus/minus net other operating income and expenses.

EBIT margin

Profit/loss before financial result as a percentage of revenues.

EBIT plus financial result.

Profit/loss as a percentage of revenues.

Plug-in-hybrid electric vehicle.

Return on capital employed (RoCE). RoCE in the Automotive and Motorcycles segments is measured on the basis of relevant segment profit before financial result and the average amount of capital employed – at the end of the last five quarters – in the segment concerned. Capital employed corresponds to the sum of all current and non-current operational assets, less liabilities that generally do not incur interest.

Return on equity (RoE). RoE in the Financial Services segment is calculated as segment profit before taxes, divided by the average amount of equity capital – at the end of the last five quarters – attributable to the Financial Services segment.

# VRRRRRRRRROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMM!!!!!! World Tour: BMW Art Car Collection celebrates 50th anniversary.
## +++ "Rolling sculptures" from Alexander Calder’s first to Julie Mehretu’s latest +++ Largest exhibition project in the history of the collection spans all five continents +++ Collaborations with cultural institutions and art platforms +++ African Film and Media Arts Collective for filmmakers and media artists +++
Date: 2025-03-13 | Author: Christiane Pyka BMW Group | ID: T0448809EN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Munich. Calder, Lichtenstein, Warhol, Holzer, Hockney, Koons, Rauschenberg, Mahlangu, Eliasson, Baldessari, Cao Fei, Mehretu. For the past 50 years, the BMW Art Car series has provided artists fascinated by automobiles with a perfect playground for art and design, technology and innovation, motorsport and engineering. The collection of 20 BMW Art Cars embodies the essence of global cultural engagement with over one hundred initiatives across contemporary art, music and film, as well as design. The "rolling sculptures" – from Alexander Calder’s first-ever Art Car to Julie Mehretu’s latest – offer a cross-section of art history over the past five decades: minimalism, pop art, magical realism, abstraction, conceptual art and digital art are all represented.

“I love that car. It has turned out better than the artwork.” Andy Warhol, BMW Art Car #4, 1979

The artists are selected by international juries of museum directors. In close collaboration with the BMW Group’s engineering and design teams, they freely develop their concepts and inspire everyone involved. To mark the 50th anniversary, the BMW Art Car World Tour features an exhibition programme spanning all five continents and including numerous accompanying events.

“The car should not only race in a physical way but also in the heart.” Cao Fei, BMW Art Car #18, 2016

An anniversary around the world.

"The BMW Art Car Collection celebrates 50 years of artistic freedom and visionary design. [ADDRESS] vehicles have become international icons, telling stories of society, technology and performance. Our commitment to art and culture is long-term. We are continuously developing the collection and bringing art and automotive culture together in a unique way," says [EXECUTIVE_OFFICER], Board Member for Human Resources and Real Estate at BMW Group.

The BMW Art Car World Tour kicks off in Europe and Asia. [ADDRESS]-21 March, the BMW Art Cars created by Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg, David Hockney and Jeff Koons will be on display at the Museum of Applied Arts and the SPARK Art Fair in Vienna for the BMW Group Niederlassung Wien event “(R)Evolution of Art”. The latest and 20th BMW Art Car – the BMW M Hybrid V8 by renowned American painter Julie Mehretu – will embark on an Asian tour and be displayed at Art Basel in Hong Kong on 28-30 March.

Mehretu is developing her Art Car project far beyond the vehicle as an object and will host workshops for young film and media artists across five African countries in 2025, together with film producer Mehret Mandefro and the BMW Group. The results of the African Film and Media Arts Collective (AFMAC) will be presented in 2026 alongside Mehretu's Art Car in an exhibition at the Zeitz MOCAA in Cape Town, curated by its Executive Director, Koyo Kouoh, the designated curator of the Venice Biennale 2026.

“The whole BMW Art Car project is about invention, about imagination, about pushing limits of what can be possible.” Julie Mehretu, BMW Art Car #20, 2024

Important museums and platforms for classic automobiles are also celebrating the milestone anniversary of the BMW Art Cars. The 13th Art Car by Sandro Chia will be showcased at the classic car festival Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este at Lake Como in May. In July and August, the Louwman Museum in The Hague will present eight BMW Art Cars in a special exhibition.

“I also thought it would be nice if women could participate other than standing around in bikinis.” Jenny Holzer, BMW Art Car #15, 1999

The BMW Museum, the home of the BMW Art Cars when they are not travelling the world, is also honouring the collection by combining two anniversaries in a special exhibition. The BMW 3 Series is also celebrating its 50th anniversary in 2025, and starting 16 June, the museum will showcase a historical overview of all BMW 3 Series models as well as the BMW M3 Art Cars by Sandro Chia, Michael Jagamara Nelson, and Ken Done.

“I think mobile museums would be a good idea. This car is the fulfilment of my dream. I would like to do ten more.” Robert Rauschenberg, BMW Art Car #6, 1986

New Art Car book, new Art Car model, new Art Car fashion collection.

In addition to the exhibition programme, BMW is releasing various new art and lifestyle products in celebration of the anniversary. [ADDRESS]:18-scale miniature of the 20th Art Car by Julie Mehretu is available for purchase across BMW Lifestyle Shops, with a 1:43 version to follow later in the year. Together with publisher Hatje Cantz, BMW is presenting the third edition of the "BMW Art Cars" catalogue. Interviews with the founders of the collection and essays on each of the 20 Art Cars highlight the art historical relevance and diversity of the works. The cover design of the new edition is by Julie Mehretu. Following the popular Alexander Calder and Roy Lichtenstein fashion collections, the third collaboration with Puma based on the BMW Art Cars will be announced later this year.

“So you can say, the BMW Art Car is definitely a typical Baldessari and the fastest artwork I ever created!” John Baldessari, BMW Art Car #19, 2016

Born from passion: a brief history of the BMW Art Car Collection.

[ADDRESS] June 1975, the BMW 3.0 CSL designed by American sculptor Alexander Calder took to the track at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. The project was initially intended as a one-time collaboration between the artist and BMW. The audience cheered for the colourful racing car and children rejoiced. BMW decided this had to continue! It all began with the passion for art and motorsport of French auctioneer and racing driver Hervé Poulain. In 1975, Poulain found a visionary ally in Jochen Neerpasch, founder and Head of BMW Motorsport, for his plan to enter a BMW designed by an artist in the legendary Le Mans endurance race. Even though the first BMW Art Car retired from the race after seven hours, it became a true crowd favourite, laying the foundations for the collection.

“Hervé, win! But drive carefully!” Alexander Calder, BMW Art Car #1, 1975

In close collaboration with legendary New York gallerist Leo Castelli, BMW Art Cars by American artists such as Frank Stella, Roy Lichtenstein and Andy Warhol followed – and all were raced by Hervé Poulain and the BMW team at Le Mans. From 1982 to 1992, the BMW Art Car Collection opened up to the world, with artists transforming various standard production models: Ernst Fuchs, Robert Rauschenberg, Michael Jagamara Nelson, Ken Done, Matazo Kayama, César Manrique, A. R. Penck, Esther Mahlangu, Sandro Chia and David Hockney. In 1999, BMW returned to motorsport with the BMW V12 LMR prototype and American conceptual artist Jenny Holzer. Eight years later, Olafur Eliasson designed "Your mobile expectations: BMW H₂R Project" based on a record-breaking hydrogen race car. Jeff Koons, John Baldessari, Cao Fei, and Julie Mehretu have added dynamic race cars over the past 15 years. Since its invention nearly 140 years ago, artists worldwide have engaged with the automobile both critically and enthusiastically. And over the last 50 years, the BMW Art Car series has contributed significantly to this inspiring dialogue.

“These race cars are like life, they are bursting with power and have enormous energy. My ideas are meant to merge with this power – it's all about fully embracing it.” Jeff Koons, BMW Art Car #17, 2010

# BMW model updates, spring 2025.
## +++ BMW i5 and BMW i5 Touring with increased range +++ New interior equipment selections for the BMW 5 Series +++ Two new powertrain variants for new BMW 2 Series Gran Coupé +++ Six-cylinder diesel variant for new BMW X3 +++ Higher charging rates for plug-in hybrid models of the BMW X1, BMW 2 Series Active Tourer, BMW 7 Series and for all BMW XM variants +++ Debut of the new BMW Digital Key Plus +++ Tyre repair kit Plus as standard on BMW X2 and additional models +++ Extended equipment features for BMW X5, BMW X6 and BMW X7 +++
Date: 2025-01-28 | Author: Cypselus von Frankenberg BMW Group | ID: T0447756EN_GB
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: This press release is a 1:1 copy of the original issued by BMW headquarters in Germany. No adaptions have been made to cater to the UK market. Munich. Electric drivetrain upgrades, new engine variants, as well as additional standard and optional equipment features will make the current BMW model range even more attractive and versatile in spring 2025. The use of new components for the power electronics and other measures designed to optimise efficiency have resulted in a considerably increased range for the all-electric BMW i5. Standard equipment on all BMW 5 Series models will soon include ambient lighting complete with a BMW Interaction Bar featuring a crystalline surface, lumbar support for both front seats as well as the Harman Kardon HiFi loudspeaker system.

Two new variants of the new BMW 2 Series Gran Coupé will become available in April 2025. The BMW X3 model range will likewise be expanded, with a powerful six-cylinder in-line diesel engine. [ADDRESS] per cent higher charging rates – that’s the news for the plug-in hybrid variants of the BMW X1, BMW 2 Series Active Tourer, BMW 7 Series and the BMW XM models. With the BMW Digital Key Plus, owners can, depending on the type of mobile device, activate up to 18 digital vehicle keys with individually configured access permissions. The new tyre repair kit Plus will become part of the standard equipment for selected BMW models from March 2025. It enables owners to continue their journey even with a tyre puncture. Adaptive LED Headlights will become part of the standard equipment for the BMW X5 and BMW X6 models in spring 2025.

BMW i5 and BMW i5 Touring now even more energy-efficient.

From March 2025 the all-electric models of the BMW 5 Series Sedan and BMW 5 Series Touring will benefit from a number of technical advances that reduce their energy consumption. The result is a noticeably greater range, with an increase of up to 47 kilometres (depending on the model and equipment installed as part of an individual vehicle configuration). This owes much to the first ever use of silicon carbide semiconductor components in the power electronics (SiC converter) of the BMW i5 and to particularly low-rolling-resistance tyres fitted to aerodynamic alloy wheels. The optimised wheel bearings will also help save power.

19" aerodynamic wheels 1056 bi-colour are available for the first time as an option for the BMW i5 eDrive40 (combined, WLTP (EnVKV): energy consumption 18.0–17.9 kWh/100 km; CO 2 emissions 0 g/km; CO 2 class A) and the BMW i5 xDrive40 (combined, WLTP (EnVKV): energy consumption 18.9–18.8 kWh/100 km; CO 2 emissions 0 g/km; CO 2 class A).

The optimisations for the new BMW i5 xDrive40 Touring (combined, WLTP (EnVKV): energy consumption 19.5–19.4 kWh/100 km; CO 2 emissions 0 g/km; CO 2 class A) lower WLTP energy consumption by up to 9 per cent (depending on model and equipment installed as part of an individual vehicle configuration), while the new BMW i5 eDrive40 saves up to 8 per cent.

Standard equipment on the BMW i5 M60 xDrive (combined, WLTP (EnVKV): energy consumption 19.5 kWh/100 km; CO 2 emissions 0 g/km; CO 2 class A) now includes the M Sport package Pro. In addition, the BMW 5 Series models benefit from further interior upgrades. From now on, all models include the previously optional ambient lighting with the BMW Interaction Bar featuring a crystalline surface as standard. In addition, they now come with lumbar support for both front seats, as well as the Harman Kardon HiFi loudspeaker system. The switchgear in the doors has also been upgraded and is now finished in high-gloss Black. BMW Individual Merino Leather in Black/Dark Violet is available as a new option for customising the interior.

BMW 2 Series Gran Coupé: Two additional powertrain variants. The new BMW 2 Series Gran Coupé model range available from March 2025 will include a new entry-level variant. The new BMW 216 Gran Coupé (combined, WLTP (EnVKV): fuel consumption 6.4 l/100 km; CO 2 emissions 145 g/km; CO 2 class E) offers a particularly attractive introduction to the world of hallmark BMW driving pleasure. [ADDRESS].5-litre three-cylinder petrol engine has 90 kW/122 hp of power and a peak torque of 230 Nm. The standard seven-speed double-clutch Steptronic transmission directs engine power to the front wheels. Accelerating the new BMW 216 Gran Coupé from 0 to 100 km/h takes 9.9 seconds.

The new BMW 223 xDrive Gran Coupé (combined, WLTP (EnVKV): fuel consumption 6.4–6.3 litres/100 km; CO 2 emissions 144 g/km; CO 2 class E) adds an all-wheel drive variant with 48-volt mild-hybrid technology to the range. Its four-cylinder petrol engine and integrated electric motor deliver a total system output of 160 kW/218 hp. This powertrain adds to the car’s efficiency and is capable of particularly fast responses. The new BMW 223 xDrive Gran Coupé accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h in 6.4 seconds. Production of the two new BMW 2 Series Gran Coupé models will start in March 2025 at the BMW Group plant in Leipzig, Germany. The BMW kidney Iconic Glow is available as part of the Innovation package and enables a purposeful customisation of the BMW 2 Series Gran Coupé’s exterior. It provides unique visuals, especially after dark. This option can also be ordered for the BMW 1 Series.

BMW X3 40d xDrive: Especially powerful six-cylinder diesel. A 3.0-litre six-cylinder in-line diesel from the latest BMW Group engine generation will complement the BMW X3 powertrain range from May 2025. It will make the new BMW X3 40d xDrive (combined, WLTP (EnVKV): fuel consumption 6.7 l/100 km; CO 2 emissions 177 g/km; CO 2 class G) the most powerful diesel variant of this premium executive Sports Activity Vehicle (SAV). Its highly efficient powertrain offers 48-volt mild-hybrid technology, a combined output of 223 kW/303 hp and 670 Nm of peak torque. The system’s electric motor is integrated into the eight‑speed Steptronic transmission. The new BMW X3 40d xDrive takes 5.4 seconds to get to 100 km/h from a standing start; its top speed is 245 km/h. It is produced at the BMW Group Plant Rosslyn in South Africa. Higher charging rates for everyday driving without generating local emissions. A faster AC charging rate, increased from 7.4 kW to 11 kW, will result in significantly reduced charging times for various BMW plug-in hybrid models from March 2025. This will benefit the plug-in hybrid variants of the BMW X1, BMW 2 Series Active Tourer, BMW 7 Series and all BMW XM models.

BMW Digital Key Plus as standard in the new BMW iX.

In the new BMW iX, the BMW Digital Key Plus will become the driver’s first choice for vehicle access from March 2025. The package also includes a physical key, a Setup Card and a Service Card.

Once activated, drivers can safely share the Digital Key Plus with others, using a simple text message. For Apple devices using iOS 18.4 or higher, up to 18 digital keys can be activated, and different roles and permissions can be set for the vehicle when sharing the keys. For example, the vehicle’s acceleration and top speed can be limited – a particularly useful feature for novice drivers. Moreover, the BMW Digital Key Plus enables additional control functions from the vehicle’s vicinity, such as having the BMW iX enter or exit a parking space via the My BMW app. And if there ever is a need to hand over a physical key, for example for service visits or in the event of a breakdown, the new Service Card can be activated as a full-fledged key with a single click.

Other digital improvements and enhancements. The popular YouTube* video app has been available for vehicles with BMW Operating [ADDRESS] since January 2025, provided the customer has activated BMW Digital Premium. Furthermore, the Personal eSIM in BMW Operating [ADDRESS] can now be activated for improved telephony and a WiFi hotspot in the vehicle.

Tyre repair kit Plus: Remaining mobile the easy way.

The new tyre repair kit Plus, part of the standard equipment for selected BMW models from March 2025, enables customers to continue their journey even with a tyre puncture. This requires just a few simple steps that are explained in the vehicle’s Integrated Owner’s Handbook. The one-piece tyre repair kit includes a magnet and connector pin to secure it to the hub of the affected wheel. A hose then fills the tyre with air and aerosol sealant using an integrated compressor. Once a sufficient tyre pressure above 1.5 bar has been achieved, the journey can be continued, with the device safely attached to the wheel hub. Drivers can now

# Additional images: BMW Group Design shows design installation “Vibrant Transitions” in Milan
## +++ BMW and MINI create thematic worlds for Milan Design Week ++ Focus on personalisation ++ New location in the historic Palazzo Borromeo d'Adda +++
Date: 2025-03-25 | Author: Michaela Martinus BMW Group | ID: T0449096EN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Munich/Milan. BMW Group Design will present the installation “Vibrant Transitions” at the Salone del Mobile design fair on 8 – 13 April 2025. Visitors to the event venue in the historic Palazzo Borromeo d'Adda in the heart of Milan will be invited to explore thematic worlds from BMW and MINI illustrating the variety and scope of individual design.

Shaping the future with positivity

Openness and individualisation are the focal points of the BMW Group’s presence at this year’s Salone del Mobile. The designers are looking to the future with an optimistic eye and with an open mind to crossovers between disciplines and brands. For the first time at this prestigious event, the design team is interpreting technology and mobility solutions across different brands. The atmospheric presentation of the installation shines a spotlight on current analogue and digital design aspects of the BMW and MINI brands – first and foremost customisable driving experiences. Material and colour worlds, light and sound experiences have been created to generate the desired effect. “Our mobility design is becoming ever broader in scope,” says Adrian van Hooydonk, Head of BMW Group Design. “Colours, materials, light, sound, geometry and digital experiences are brought together over the course of each project to create exciting and emotional customer experiences. With this in mind, our ‘Vibrant Transitions’ installation provides visitors to the Salone del Mobile with some inspirational insights.”

Seeing, hearing, feeling: as they enter the Palazzo Borromeo d'Adda, visitors can decide for themselves which route they would like to follow. Colour- accentuated corridors lead to the individual thematic areas and use translucent lamella structures to create distinctive visual perspectives both outwards and inwards. “Vibrant Transitions” explores light, colour, geometry and permeability. The installation shows how the BMW Group is channelling the spirit of openness and the allure of design as it enters a new era. The creative blueprint for the installation was to make transitions something visitors could experience. This is made possible by spatial flows, the interplay of day and night, and the fusion of materiality and digitality. Its execution delves into the intriguing contrasts between the MINI and BMW brands.

Individualisation as an expression of our personalities

Occupying centre stage in the installation’s three design worlds are the all-new BMW Panoramic iDrive (the revolutionary display and operating concept for the Neue Klasse), the BMW X3 “Designer's Choice” curated specially for the Salone del Mobile and the BMW CE 02 by MINI Design – a fresh and stylish, colour-rich version of the fully electric scooter. The perspectives generated through this spatial dialogue emphasise the vibrancy and positivity with which BMW Group Design is approaching the changing demands placed on future-oriented vehicle design. Everything is linked together, things can no longer be viewed separately from one another. It is about the blending of material, colour, form, digitality, sound and light. And behind it all is the newly created, cross-brand design team who have developed the creative concept in collaboration with Designworks, subsidiary of the BMW Group

The all-new BMW Panoramic iDrive represents the ideal symbiosis of technologies at the cutting edge of innovation and intuitive design. It has been designed with pixel precision to provide a holistic experience, customisable yet always with a clear BMW identity. In Milan, it is presented in an arcade created from a variety of materials, textures, light and sound accents which visitors wander through intuitively.

The BMW X3 “Designer's Choice” in the courtyard shows how individualisation through colour and material design can be used to maximise the expression of personality. Top-quality materials and appointments generate a new level of exclusivity in the interior, e.g. through the interplay of hard and soft surfaces. The exterior colour FROZEN TANZANITE BLUE lends the car an incomparable presence and brings sporting dynamism together with timeless elegance. The matte finish underscores the clear lines and contours. The dark blue shade subtly absorbs the light and creates a mysterious, luxurious look.

The MINI Neon Garden City invites visitors to linger for a while in the open air. Here, the BMW Group is showcasing its vision for urban spaces and its commitment to electric mobility – with the MINI Cooper Electric and the fully electric BMW CE 02 by MINI Design, whose colour concept was developed by the MINI Design studio specifically for the event in Milan. MINI stands out with its intelligent integration of characteristic design elements that give its

vehicles their unmistakable appearance. From unique colour accents to meticulously selected textiles – every detail of a MINI is defined by a certain personality. With their well-chosen graphical design elements in green, the two exhibits celebrate city living – appropriately so, given the setting for the Salone del Mobile in Milan. Agile, compact and electric, a healthy dose of driving/riding fun is guaranteed.

London/Munich. From [ADDRESS] to 19, Frieze London and Frieze Masters will return to London’s Regent’s Park. As one of Frieze’s long-standing global partners since 2004, BMW honours the artistic work of David Hockney as part of the BMW Art Car World Tour and provides VIP shuttle service. Frieze London takes its place on the global stage as part of the ever-expanding BMW Art Car World Tour, a journey that will span continents and continue well into 2026. Marking the 50th anniversary of this iconic series, the tour brings together a constellation of exhibitions across five continents, enriched by a vibrant array of events.

The iconic Art Car #14, designed by David [ADDRESS] years ago, will be on display in The Lobby of The Peninsula London from [ADDRESS] to [ADDRESS]. During the “Peninsula Classic Car Afternoon Tea” which runs through [ADDRESS] there will be a special opportunity to engage with Hockney’s Art Car: BMW representatives will dive deep into the origins and lead through the journey of Hockney’s Art Car design on [ADDRESS] and 15. Sculptural culinary delights will be served to bring together the British tea tradition and the BMW Art Cars’ golden jubilee. The final days of the exhibition coincide with RM Sotheby’s Classic Car auction presented in partnership with the Royal Automobile Club which brings a selection of significant automobiles– from historic treasures to modern collectibles – to The Peninsula.

David Hockney’s BMW 850CSi puts a new spin on the traditional idea of a car’s paintwork by effectively turning the car inside out. “I thought it would be a good idea to show the car as if one could see inside,” he said. Like an X-ray, Hockney’s design reveals the anatomy of the car and its occupants: the door sports an outline of the driver, and Hockney’s loyal dachshund, Stanley, can be seen sitting on the back seat, referencing the artist’s love of his dogs. Stylised engine components are depicted on the bonnet, while expanses of green sweep across the body – a visual metaphor for the passing scenery, movement, and time. Hockney’s visual language melds the car’s interior and the outside world to create a new and unusual perspective on motoring.

Born in Bradford, England, in 1937, David Hockney has been one of the most flamboyant and influential protagonists on the international art scene since the early 1960s. He graduated from the Royal College of Art in 1962 and soon joined the exclusive circles of Swinging Sixties London. He established his style as his very own form of international Pop Art and achieved great popularity with it. His works – among them iconic images depicting swimming pools and Californian landscapes – illustrate his lifelong fascination with light, colour, and the relationship between perspective and movement. David Hockney’s Art Car was intended solely as an exhibition piece and has never been driven on the road or in a race.

The BMW Art Car World Tour charts an ambitious course, with stops at prestigious destinations such as Art Basel Hong Kong, the Le Mans Classic in France, Belgium’s Zoute Grand Prix, the Shanghai Motor Show in China, and Italy’s Concorso d’Eleganza, among others. Showcasing the collection of 20 iconic BMW Art Cars, the tour serves as a testament to the company’s deep-rooted commitment to global cultural engagement – spanning more than a hundred initiatives across contemporary art, music, film, and design. Follow the journey here .

# MINI is the official car of RB Leipzig during the German club’s tour in Brazil
## • Partnership is the result of production of the MINI Countryman at the BMW Group plant in Leipzig, Germany • The German team faced Santos Football Club in a friendly match last Wednesday, 28th May
Date: 2025-05-29 | Author: Erika Ferrer BMW Group | ID: T0450501EN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
São Paulo, 29th May, 2025 – A partnership that crossed the Atlantic Ocean and landed in Brazil. This is what unites MINI and the German football club RB Leipzig, which was on tour in Brazil and has MINI as its brand and official car during its stay in the country.

The partnership stems from a historic milestone. The BMW Group’s plant in Leipzig, where the first MINI that is being produced in a BMW factory in Germany. The new generation of the MINI Countryman, in all its versions, is manufactured at the facility located next to the German club’s headquarters.

# BMW is once again bringing an exclusive study for a small series to Lake Como this year: The BMW Concept Speedtop
## +++ Exclusive three-door interpretation of a BMW Touring +++ Unique colour and material concept +++ Limited-run small series for collectors and enthusiasts +++
Date: 2025-05-23 | Author: Laura Kanamueller BMW Group | ID: T0450205EN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Munich/Cernobbio. At the Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este 2025, the renowned celebration of historic vehicles on the shores of Lake Como in Italy, the BMW Group is presenting an exclusive new concept car that will subsequently be made available for purchase in a small series.

The BMW Concept Speedtop reimagines the sporty Touring, blending the elegance of a shooting brake with unique proportions. "A true BMW exudes dynamism and elegance even when it’s standing still," says Adrian van Hooydonk, Head of BMW Group Design. "And that’s also the case with our new concept car. The #BMW Concept Speedtop is characterised first of all by its profile. It is very unique in the automotive industry. In this way, we have created an exclamation mark for our entire lineup of vehicles, especially for the Touring models."

The generous interior invites for weekend getaways for two. High-quality materials, the focus on every detail, and the stylistic connection between exterior and interior are a testament for its true craftsmanship.

The #BMW Concept Speedtop shares its eye-catching form language with the BMW Skytop and will be offered to collectors and connoisseurs in a strictly limited small series.

The pronounced V-shape of the front end, with its shark-nose design, the slim front lights and the illuminated kidney grille give the BMW Concept Speedtop an unmistakable presence. The continuation of the central spline from the bonnet over the roof to the rear spoiler gives the car a dynamic Touring profile. The colour gradient on the roof, moving from “Floating Sunstone Maroon” to “Floating Sundown Silver”, accentuates this shape. The athletic design is enhanced by the car’s broad shoulders. Its elegance is underscored by two-tone, 14-spoke wheels, which have been designed specifically for the BMW Concept Speedtop.

The interior of the BMW Concept Speedtop was designed with a strong focus to even the smallest detail. Skillfully crafted, traditional brogue-style details accentuate the leather-trimmed surfaces and emphasise the manufactory-level craftmanship on display.

The two-tone colour and material concept creates a connection between the exterior and interior. The sparkling brown tone of the “Floating Sunstone Maroon” exterior paint is carried over into the interior. Here, the brown "Sundown Maroon" world harmonises with the light "Moonstone White" of the seats. The two-tone leather upholstery divides the dynamic and functional areas of the interior. The visually striking roof spline in the exterior is mirrored as a light beam in the two-tone leather headliner, providing an atmospheric, indirect illumination. The trunk is also leather-covered and refined with brogue-style perforations.

A light beam illuminates the luggage compartment, which is divided into two sections. This allows large items of luggage to be stowed inside for multi-day trips. The elaborate craftsmanship in the exterior and interior was realised with the expertise of the Manufactory workshop at the BMW Group plant in Dingolfing.

The virtuosity in the design of the BMW Concept Speedtop is further enhanced through the collaboration with the traditional Italian manufacturer Schedoni. Known for the production of exclusive and high-quality leather goods by hand, especially in the automotive sector, Schedoni has always stood for highest quality and customisation. Two storage areas with leather straps behind the seats provide space for two of Schedoni’s made-to-measure bags. The bags were designed exclusively for the Concept to fit in with its colour and material concept. A matching weekend bag can also be accommodated in the trunk.

The concept car’s engine ensures it scales the heights not only in terms of design, but also performance. It is fitted with the most powerful V8 engine currently offered by BMW.

"Last year, the presentation of the BMW Concept Skytop at the Concorso d'Eleganza Villa d'Este on Lake Como generated great enthusiasm among connoisseurs and automotive enthusiasts," says Bernd Körber, Senior Vice President BMW Brand and Product Management. "This led to a strictly limited production run of 50 units. Thanks to this positive response, this year we have decided to also offer the BMW Concept Speedtop in a limited production series of 70 units. This extraordinary vehicle is now available for order. We are pleased to be able to offer collectors and enthusiasts another exclusive model."

# Endurance test for “Heart of Joy”: the BMW Vision Driving Experience.
## +++ Top-class dynamics, precision, efficiency and driving pleasure +++ New “Heart of Joy” central computer works ten times faster +++ Extending the recuperation range increases efficiency by 25% +++

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Spartanburg / Munich. Showcasing driving pleasure up to the physical limits is the BMW Group’s mission with its new high-performance test vehicle – the #BMW Vision Driving Experience . This Vision Vehicle is not destined for series production, but is instead serving as a rolling test rig for drivetrain and driving dynamics management technology developed specially for the Neue Klasse – the next generation of BMW vehicles – and referred to by BMW as the #Heart of Joy . The prototype car put the capabilities of the Heart of Joy to the ultimate test of endurance at the BMW Performance Driving Center in Spartanburg, USA. And the company provided exclusive insights into its development programme for the electric driving experience on board the Neue Klasse as part of a preview presentation. Every fully electric Neue Klasse model will benefit from the Heart of Joy. The first taller Neue Klasse electric model will go into series production later this year at Plant Debrecen in Hungary. The new Heart of Joy adds a fourth dimension – BMW’s hallmark Sheer Driving Pleasure – to the existing trio of Neue Klasse characteristics (electrical, digital, circular). [EXECUTIVE_OFFICER], Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG, took to the stage at the IAA 2023 show holding the small black box. It is important to note that the control unit will go into series production, but the Vision Vehicle will not.

“The Heart of Joy enables us to take driving pleasure not just to the next level, but another one beyond that,” says Frank Weber, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, responsible for Development. “In addition, we are further increasing efficiency, and therefore boosting range, as in future the driver will brake almost exclusively using energy regeneration. This is Efficient Dynamics squared.”

The Heart of Joy control unit for the drivetrain, brakes, charging, recuperation and steering subfunctions processes information ten times faster than previous systems. Working in tandem with the BMW Dynamic Performance Control software, the Heart of Joy computes all the driving dynamics functions with a whole new level of speed and precision. The software has been developed entirely in-house on the back of experience in the field of driving dynamics amassed by BMW engineers over more than a century. The Vision Vehicle develops 18,000 Newton metres (13,269 lb-ft) of torque. The reasoning behind this is that if the control system can deal with an explosion of power of this magnitude, it will be able to handle the demands of everyday driving with ease.

Energy recovery under braking (also known as recuperation) sees the drivetrain and braking functions of electric vehicles forming a symbiosis. In the innovative electronics architecture of the Neue Klasse, the Heart of Joy is one of four central control units and combines drivetrain and driving dynamics functions for the first time. These innovative control functions are protected by several patent applications. The high-performance unit controls acceleration and braking, vehicle stabilisation, dynamic steering functions and charging management. The central processing unit and perfectly coordinated BMW Dynamic Performance Control software developed in-house enable all connected actuators to respond directly and with minimal delay: latencies are in the millisecond range. By contrast, conventional systems have separate control algorithms for the drive system and brakes. This means the full handling potential of vehicles with powerful electric drive systems cannot be fully exploited.

The driver and passengers here experience a harmonious and noiseless driving feeling – regardless of the situation and speed they are travelling at. In dynamic driving scenarios, the new Heart of Joy / BMW Dynamic Performance Control combination serves up cornering poise and assurance beyond compare. The car generates impressive traction and can be threaded through corners with exceptional precision. Fewer control inputs are required and the car’s line can be maintained with greater precision and stability. This helps the car to develop consistent, reproducible cornering behaviour and allows it to be steered more intuitively and smoothly. At low speeds – such as in stop-start driving or when parking – direct signal transmissions and rapid information processing ensure an even more compelling driving experience. In driving modes D or B, or when using Active Cruise Control, the parking brake or parking lock, stopping and restarting merge seamlessly into one another.

Furthermore, integrated drivetrain, braking and energy recuperation control allows energy to be used more sustainably. 98 per cent of drivers do not need to make any inputs using the conventional brakes. The braking power generated using energy recuperation is sufficient for normal, everyday driving. Only under heavy braking, e.g. in an emergency situation, is intervention required from the friction brakes. All in all, this system increases efficiency by up to 25 per cent.

The BMW Vision Driving Experience test vehicle demonstrates how the Heart of Joy works using illuminating colour codes on the wheel rims: acceleration is indicated in green, energy recuperation in blue and braking using the friction brakes in orange.

Four totally new super-brains will go to work in the BMW of the future. These high-performance computers cleverly combine various elements that previously ran separately. The Heart of Joy was developed 100 percent within the company. It allows four important control units to be brought together within a single high-performance computer.

Another three super-brains are responsible for features including automated and highly automated driving, infotainment and basic functions such as climate control and comfort-enhancing systems, vehicle access, interior and exterior lighting.

The BMW Vision Driving Experience will celebrate its official world premiere at #Auto Shanghai 2025.

# BMW NA 50th Anniversary | 50 Stories for 50 Years [ADDRESS]: “Motorcycles for the Police: BMW wins over the California Highway Patrol”
## BMW has been building motorcycles for police and the military since the early 1930s, and its bikes are widely used by police departments from Europe to the Far East. In the US, however, BMWs have always been somewhat rare compared to the Harley-Davidsons favored by patrol officers on the East Coast or the Kawasakis preferred out West.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BMW has been building motorcycles for police and the military since the early 1930s, and its bikes are widely used by police departments from Europe to the Far East. In the US, however, BMWs have always been somewhat rare compared to the Harley-Davidsons favored by patrol officers on the East Coast or the Kawasakis preferred out West.

BMW first challenged both of those well-established marques in 1984, when it sold about 150 of its R 100 RT motorcycles to the San Francisco Police Department. Although that program was considered successful, BMW withdrew from the authority market after Kawasaki lost a $10 million liability suit related to the death of a Houston officer while on duty. A few years later, the introduction of anti-lock braking on the K 100 and K 75 led BMW to reconsider.

“We started dipping our toes back into the police business with the K 75,” said Frank Stevens, then BMW Motorrad USA’s National Sales Manager. “We did some test sales, but the K 75 was not an ideal police motorcycle because of its riding position, its saddlebag design and storage. It was expensive if you dropped it or fell over, because the protection system wasn’t very good.”

The California Highway Patrol had a fleet of about 400 motorcycles, of which it replaced about 150 each year. In 1994, the organization agreed to purchase 20 ABS-equipped BMW K 75 RT-Ps to test against the Kawasaki KZ1000P, which constituted the majority of its fleet but hadn’t been updated since 1982.

“ABS was generally perceived by the CHP as a real benefit, but they couldn’t find any statistical way to prove it, and because of that they couldn’t mandate it,” Stevens said. Nonetheless, BMW used data from the K 75 RT-P test to improve its forthcoming R 1100 RT-P, which would be equipped with not only ABS (and the K 75’s adjustable windscreen) but better protection bars and other features to suit the CHP’s needs. That included a second battery with linked charging from a more powerful alternator, and an auxiliary fan behind the oil cooler that allowed the bike to idle for extensive periods without overheating—a huge advantage over Harley, in particular. Its handling was more stable than that of the K 75 RT-P, yet the R 1100 RT-P also had greater agility, including the essential ability to make a U-turn within 16 feet.

The new R 1100 RT-P was significantly better than its K 75 RT-P predecessor, and it easily outperformed the Kawasaki and the Harley. Unfortunately, its price of $15,828—as reported by the San Francisco Chronicle —was more than twice the $7,871 price for a Kawasaki. The R 1100 RT-P’s maintenance costs per mile were lower than those of the KZ1000 P, but BMW still had to get creative in order to secure the CHP contract.

“We didn’t want the liability of a lease, so we sold the motorcycles with a buy-back clause,” Stevens said. “The perceived useful life of the motorcycles was 60,000 miles, but we knew the motorcycle had a tremendous amount of life beyond 60,000 miles. California agreed to pay much more up front because their total cost would be less, if the motorcycle survived to the end of the term.”

BMW agreed to re-purchase the bikes for $9,928 each, reducing the net cost to $5,900—$100 lower than the price of the Kawasaki that the state would typically auction for $600-1,800 after three years on the road.

It was the first time California had been able to include a buy-back clause in its cost calculations, and Stevens credited Jerry Haleva’s lobbying firm, Sergeant Major Associates, for getting it done. “It was our idea, but Jerry got it signed off,” Stevens said.

That wasn’t the end of the process, however. The initial approval of the R 1100 RT-P had been made by a sergeant at the CHP Academy who’d left in the interim, and his replacement had to confirm that the bikes being delivered met the standard established during testing. While riding the bike at the CHP’s test track, the new sergeant detected a wobble after crossing a drainage rut. Stevens flew to California to investigate but found nothing wrong; indeed, the bike was functioning as-designed, self-correcting after the disruption. When the CHP sergeant refused to accept that explanation, Stevens called his counterpart in Germany, Fritz Leitner.

“He said, ‘You need to change to radial tires and use cast wheels from the civilian side,’ but we’d already proofed out run-flat bias-ply tires on spoked wheels that were really good on potholes,” Stevens said. “Thank goodness [local Sacramento dealer] A&S had a bunch of RTs in the showroom. We grabbed the wheels and installed the Dunlop tires with the stiffest sidewalls, so they’d pass the run-flat test, but then the speedo drive was wrong, the center stand was wrong, and the side stand was wrong, so we had to change all that, too. It passed the test, and they loved it, but I told them they were going to bend some wheels hitting potholes. They said they didn’t care, but after they’d bent about 150 wheels, they started to rethink that!”

A&S had been a BMW dealer since 1988, and the firm had won the contract to supply the CHP with motorcycles thanks in part to its location in Roseville, just outside Sacramento. “There were only a couple of dealers that had the capability of doing that contract,” Stevens said. “You have to have a lot of staffing, a big facility, and a lot of money to buy these things and wait for the state to pay you.”

A&S delivered the earlier K 75s to the CHP, then fulfilled the larger order of R 1100 RT-Ps. “We built all of the original bikes, like 25 a month,” said Howard Pine, son of A&S founder Sheldon Pine. “We loaded up truck after truck, and we never had a bike damaged in transit.”

Following delivery, A&S’ role was like that of any BMW dealer in California. “Each CHP office had their bikes serviced by local dealers, and BMW NA handled the buy-back operation,” Pine said. “Every dealer had the option to buy those used bikes from NA for local sales, so they got spread across the state.”

Though the BMWs required less maintenance than the Kawasakis—fluid changes took place every 6,000 miles rather than 3,000 or 3,500 miles, while shaft drive eliminated the need for chain adjustment or replacement—that was mitigated by the significant mileage each bike accumulated. “I think the record was 60,000 miles in 17 months,” Stevens said. “A lot of the bikes would reach the 60,000-mile limit in 24 or 30 months, so they moved the limit to 80,000 miles, then 100,000 and 120,000.”

The need for frequent maintenance was a boon to local BMW dealers. “It’s a wonderful boost to the dealer service business,” Stevens said. “If officers were fortunate enough not to pick up a nail, they’d still wear tires out within 4-6,000 miles, depending on how the officer rode, and they’d have to look at the brake pads at every service, because they go through brakes much faster.”

BMW could sell plenty of parts, which helped to make the program profitable despite the buy-back clause. The program also brought new customers to the marque, as the officers who rode BMWs on duty bought BMWs as personal transportation.

“They discovered how well BMW dealers take care of their customers, which created a bond of loyalty that certainly didn’t exist with Kawasaki,” Stevens said, noting that CHP officers were also given a discount on BMW’s civilian bikes. “They experienced a relationship that radiates through all of the people within their orbit of influence, and it really did contribute noticeably to sales of motorcycles in California.”

In 2001, the civilian R 1100 RT models were superseded by the R 1150, which itself was followed in 2004 by the R 1200 RT and in 2019 by the current R 1250 RT. Each of those was offered as an RT-P Authority bike a few years later, with upgrades to its chassis and drivetrain that benefitted officers just as they had civilians. (Though BMW offers a full range of Authority models, including scooters, US agencies prefer the boxer-engine RT-P over the parallel twins or scooters used elsewhere.) Electronic engine management, for instance, allows the BMWs to use regular fuel where the Harleys and Kawasakis require premium. “The officers have to buy fuel from retail stations, and BMW’s knock sensors allow it to tolerate regular fuel that saves thousands of dollars a year in fuel costs,” Stevens said.

The bikes have also benefitted from improvements to their police-specific equipment, much of which was designed by Stevens in New Jersey and then tested by BMW Motorrad in Munich or Berlin. In 2003, for instance, Stevens persuaded the CHP to stop reusing its old sirens and lighting systems in favor of modern, better-integrated equipment, as well as updated wiring systems for radio and radar. “They loved that idea, and we were really able to bump our volume with sirens and lights,” Stevens said. A freewheeling alternator, meanwhile, improved the longevity of the drive belt, while a throttle stop prevented cables from breaking when officers twisted the grip too forcefully. More recently, Stevens developed holsters that allowed CHP officers to carry not just their duty pistols but their duty rifles on their motorcycles as well.

The California Highway Patrol loved the BMWs, but the program didn’t continue without interruption. Under Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, the CHP began buying Harley-Davidsons, newly equipped with ABS. Even so, the CHP continues to add new BMWs to its fleet, though the buy-back provision no longer applies. So do other agencies throughout the US, many of which piggyback on the State of California’s approval process when supplying their own fleets. Today, about 3,500 R 1250 RT-P motorcycles are in service in this country, used by more than 500 state and local police forces including the Los Angeles Police and Sheriff’s Departments, the City of Phoenix and the Arizona Department of Public Safety, the City and County of San Diego, the cities of Anaheim and Fresno, and the Honolulu Police Department.

# On the podium again! MINI JCW and Bulldog Racing in 2nd place in the SP3T-class at the 24 Hours of Nürburgring.
## Top racing performance, impressive endurance and genuine team spirit: MINI John Cooper Works and Bulldog Racing achieve another spectacular success in the SP3T class at the 24 Hours of Nürburgring.

Nürburg. Sensational result for MINI John Cooper Works and Bulldog Racing at the 24 hours of Nürburgring: at the end of an exciting race weekend, the team achieved second place in the SP3T class - behind the BMW M2 Racing.

[ADDRESS] laps and over 2,700 kilometers completed over a 24-hour period, the crew impressively demonstrated the engineering skills of the MINI brand - and showed real team spirit in one of the toughest challenges in motor racing.

Following last year's class victory and second place in 2023, this is the third podium finish in a row for the MINI John Cooper Works and Bulldog Racing team in the highly competitive SP3T class.

The cockpit team of Samantha Tan (CAN), Toby Goodman (GBR), Sebastian Sauerbrei (GER) and Markus Fischer (AUT) in the MINI John Cooper Works not only proved their driving skills and stamina in the “Green Hell” - but also real nerves of steel: After a successful start, the 24-hour race had to be interrupted on Saturday afternoon due to a power failure: The restart only took place after around two hours at 7:45 pm. With full focus, the driver team continued the race through the shortest night of the year - and made up over 60 places in the overall standings over the course of the race.

As in the previous year, Markus Fischer drove the team's fastest lap. With a strong lap time of 10:02, he was even able to beat last year's fastest lap. It was the first 24 hours of Nürburgring for Samantha Tan and Toby Goodman - and a successful premiere with second place in the SP3T class.

It was not only with sensational lap times and impressive endurance that the MINI 24-hour race car earned the respect of competitors and spectators at the Nürburgring: thanks to its exterior skin designed exclusively with the fashion and lifestyle brand Deus Ex Machina, the MINI John Cooper Works was a highlight of the race weekend even before the start.

280,000 fans cheered on the teams at the 24-hour race at the Nürburgring - a new record. This makes the race one of the most popular motorsport events in the world again this year. There was also a lot of action off the track: some racing enthusiasts stayed up late into the night with the teams and celebrated the drivers at the 53rd edition of the legendary Eifel classic - around the clock.

We congratulate our colleagues from ROWE Racing with the BMW M4 GT3 Evo on their overall victory and first place in the SP3T class with the BMW M2 Racing.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Good morning.

Thanks to the strength and foresight of our strategy, our attractive product portfolio and our global team and operations, the BMW Group is built to weather various conditions.

This is what separates us from the competition. And it underscores that there is not ONE automotive industry – major players are currently performing quite differently.

Through the first half-year, our sales performance demonstrates the appeal of our global brands and the ongoing success of our broad technological approach.

After confirming our original guidance from our Annual Conference after the first quarter results, we remain on track with our financial targets for the year – despite ongoing tariff uncertainty and fluctuations in the Chinese market.

Unpredictability is a longstanding feature of the auto industry and is the norm in today’s business environment. What is decisive is how you deal with it. Because global success is rather predicated on your ability to anticipate developments and to respond rationally and efficiently.

That is fundamental to the BMW Group. And we are building upon our leading position in the industry.

The overall global automotive market is growing. We are always ready to profitably gain market share wherever individual market conditions allow. As dynamics in the industry shift, we know exactly where we are placed with our premium brands and where we can pursue opportunities – maintaining a healthy balance of value and volume.

Over many decades, we have built up a comprehensive and balanced network of sales, production and supply chain operations spanning the major regions. This makes us one of the few truly global players in the industry and our deep roots in global markets offer us many advantages.

First, they allow us to tap into leading-edge developments in the individual markets and understand specific customer needs. Our ties to research universities, our R&D network and IT hubs and our network of local tech partners enable us to leverage key competencies from individual markets for our global products and strategy.

Second, through our extensive footprint in key markets, we remain resilient in the face of geopolitical instability and ever-increasing regulation.

Finally, our strong ties also allow us to engage in direct discussions with key political decision-makers, who value our perspective. Here, it is not just about our individual interests, but rather finding solutions for customers worldwide and driving shared economic prosperity.

The BMW Group welcomes the fundamental agreement between the European Union and the United States to reduce tariffs on both sides of the Atlantic. It’s now important to quickly finalize and implement the agreed measures.

We will continue to advocate for trade between the EU and the US not be hindered by import tariffs. The currently agreed US tariffs also burden European exports, affecting consumers and globally operating companies. Therefore, we urge both sides to continue working towards market openness and the convergence of technical regulations.

Through our global production network and supply chains, we maintain high flexibility to respond to fluctuations. Our production plants are attuned to market demand, allowing us to achieve capacity utilization above the industry standards.

At our largest single plant in Spartanburg in the United States, for example, we produce over 400,000 vehicles annually. Over half of which serve the local market and half of which we export. Across the United States we have created extensive value chains as well as a competency hub for our global X Family of vehicles in Spartanburg, which remain in high demand across the entire globe.

BMW made in America and sold to the world.

This combination of leveraging the competitive advantage of the US market in SUVs with BMW’s brand strength allows us to develop products which speak to customers’ needs in markets worldwide.

For the current financial year, our sales results continued into Q2 in line with our expectations, as conditions continue to vary from market to market. In Q2, we saw a sequential improvement from Q1.

Outside of China, all three of our major sales regions posted growth.

Group sales in these markets combined to grow by 6.3% through the first six months of the year.

Group sales in Europe grew overall by 10.2% in the second quarter and in Germany alone by over 10%, with growth in most markets outpacing the passenger vehicle market. Overall, the BMW brand increased its market share in Europe.

Among the most successful BMW models were those in the business class segment. In the first half of the year, the BMW 5 Series saw growth of more than 40% worldwide compared to 2024.

Other notable models that saw success included the BMW X2 models, which more than doubled sales through June.

With the full availability of the new MINI family, the brand grew in all regions worldwide, including in China. In the first half of the year, more than one in three MINIs sold was a BEV.

Rolls-Royce increased deliveries by nearly 10% in the second quarter, driven by strong sales from the Cullinan Series II*.

Drivetrains and model variants across the portfolio continued to see success in Q2. BMW M sold nearly 106,000 vehicles through June, the best-ever first half-year for the brand.

Sales of plug-in hybrid models from the BMW brand grew by almost 30% in the first six months. Our BEV models continue to be a fundamental pillar of our strategy. In the second quarter, we achieved an important milestone, with the delivery of our 1.5-millionth all-electric vehicle. Across the portfolio, we now offer more than 15 all-electric models.

In Europe, the Group’s BEV share reached 25%. With PHEVs included, the electrified share reached nearly 40%. Across all brands, BMW is the third best-selling BEV brand in Europe.

While we are proud of our position as a leading BEV player, we know that the world is multi-dimensional.

To meet consumer needs, especially in a product as complex and personal as a car, there is no single answer. Our Q2 results show that we can serve multiple preferences simultaneously: BEVs, PHEVs and our M models all achieved growth.

The most effective strategic approach is to use all technologies to reduce CO2 emissions overall. We remain committed to the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement, while advocating for a review of the 2030 and 2035 targets in the EU.

To achieve these goals and create effective CO2 regulations, we must take a comprehensive view across the entire value chain. This would consider all emissions across the entire life cycle and not just tailpipe emissions: from the supply chain to the raw materials used in the car, the production process, the vehicle drive, energy used to power the vehicle, and finally to recycling.

A dependency on a single technology can be damaging to an industry. Putting all your eggs in one basket is just poor asset allocation.

Hydrogen, for example, offers Europe an opportunity to use our expertise and take the lead on an emerging technology that will contribute to our climate goals. And, unlike BEVs, without the need for large amounts of raw materials or battery technology which are not localizable at large scale in Europe.

Beyond drivetrains, there is great potential with alternative fuels. There are more than 250 million vehicles in the EU, which could now immediately contribute to climate protection. But this requires a clear regulatory pathway and targeted investments in the ramp-up of all renewable fuels.

Take HVO100 as an example. While it is already available in markets across Europe, tax schemes and the CO2 fleet targets need to recognize this renewable fueling option to incentivize customer adoption. This would help in scaling an alternative fuel that has a 90% CO2 saving compared to normal fuels and can already be accessed today. For OEMs and customers, this is also a cost-effective way to reduce emissions in the use phase.

For Europe to maintain competitiveness and finance its future, we need to invest not only in new technologies, but also leverage our existing technologies, which can meet customer preferences and still contribute to climate targets.

For the BMW Group, we are now just five weeks away from the next major innovation step, which our entire company has been fully focused on for many years now: the launch of the NEUE KLASSE.

On September 5th, we will celebrate the world premiere of the all-new BMW iX3* at the IAA Mobility here in Munich.

In June we hosted media representatives at the pre-drive event in Miramas in southern France. The initial feedback has been tremendous.

We remain right on time with the launch, including at our new Plant in Debrecen. Construction also continues at our battery assembly facility in Irlbach-Straßkirchen.

With the NEUE KLASSE, we are making great strides in all relevant technology fields – whether in electrification, digital user experience, driving dynamics or sustainability.

The new BMW iX3 will be benchmark in the industry.

The all-electric 6th generation powertrain will set standards in performance and efficiency:

In addition, our revolutionary new iDrive will change the way the driver interacts with the car. With the BMW iDrive, we set an industry standard more than twenty years ago. After the reveal of the all-new Panoramic iDrive at CES in January, we are already seeing the industry follow our lead.

With the technology clusters we have developed for the NEUE KLASSE, we will scale our advanced technologies across the portfolio. We will start in the core segment to build momentum quickly. This is simply smart economics.

By 2027, we will bring 40 new models and model updates with NEUE KLASSE technology and design language on the road worldwide.

Our technology cluster approach also allows us to integrate market-specific features and content. In our major sales regions, we have a variety of local solutions with leading partners. This allows us, for example, to further enhance the digital user experience as well as automated driving functions in our upcoming NEUE KLASSE models.

In China, we are collaborating with Alibaba Banma to develop the next level of intuitive and conversational in-car voice interaction. We will also enhance our BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant with functionality from DeepSeek in our vehicles in China.

In most other countries, the next-gen BMW intelligent personal assistant will be powered by large language model technology from Amazon Alexa.

For driving assistance systems that meet local needs and regulations, we have also sought out partners in different geographies. Always following our philosophy in this area: smart, symbiotic and safe.

Just two weeks ago, we announced a new partnership with Momenta, a leading Chinese ADAS technology provider. The partnership will focus on software development and integration for Chinese road-networks, traffic-conditions and user expectations, utilizing advanced AI algorithms and data driven development methods. We will launch the systems in China starting with our NEUE KLASSE.

In other markets, we continue to build on our already very successful partnership with Qualcomm.

These examples show how adaptive the NEUE KLASSE architecture is.

With a software-defined vehicle, we maintain competency over all systems of the car and can roll them out to markets at the same time across the world. But we also are able to quickly integrate local tech stacks into our own ecosystem to give consumers access to innovations and features they are used to.

And through backward integration of software solutions available for all aspects of the vehicle over the air, we will continuously enhance the customer experience.

This is a huge advantage for us.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Our consistent strategic approach and continued success is not a coincidence but the result of resolute, long-term planning and orientation. It is a multi-year process in every area of the company.

This is what our stakeholders expect from us.

The BMW brand is a promise. And we deliver on our promises.

We continue to build upon the strong position we are in today.

With the rollout of NEUE KLASSE technologies and products over the next two years, we will bring the company to a whole new level.

“We wanted to create something our family would remember forever: a Rolls-Royce that captures the essence of the cosmos and shows that no dream is out of reach.” Commissioning Client, Cullinan Cosmos “Space travel is an enduring fascination for the commissioning clients of this extraordinary one-of-one motor car. For the Bespoke Collective, this project also explored new frontiers, with our first-ever hand-painted Starlight Headliner. Bold in its conception and spectacular in its realisation, this commission demonstrates how Rolls-Royce brings clients’ otherworldly visions to life with drama, depth, and absolute precision.” Phil Fabre de la Grange, Head of Bespoke, Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Rolls-Royce presents Cullinan Cosmos: a one-of-one commission that celebrates the drama of outer space. Commissioned by a family who shares a fascination for the universe with their four-year-old son, this theme was brought to life through a constellation of Bespoke details. At its centre is a Rolls-Royce first – a hand-painted Starlight Headliner painstakingly developed by one of the marque’s in-house artists over 160 hours. EXTERIOR PALETTE: OUTER LIMITS Cullinan Cosmos is finished in shimmering Arabescato Pearl, recalling the soft lustre of moonlight across a midnight sky. The exterior is completed with a hand-painted twin coachline in Charles Blue and an Illuminated Spirit of Ecstasy that glows like a distant star by night. INTERIOR SUITE: EXPLORING INNER SPACE The interior of Cullinan Cosmos offers a calm, meditative environment, inspired by the stillness and wonder of deep space. The reclining seats are finished in Charles Blue and Grace White leather with matching Grace White contrast stitching and piping. Piano White veneers add a crisp, technical edge that subtly echoes the high-gloss surfaces of satellite casings. The commissioning clients worked with Rolls-Royce designers to create a unique Star Cluster motif, which appears as Bespoke embroidery on the door panels and headrests, and as a hand-painted artwork on the front passenger fascia. HAND-PAINTED STARLIGHT HEADLINER: NEW HORIZONS Cullinan Cosmos features the first fully hand-painted Starlight Headliner ever created for a Rolls-Royce motor car. Developed over 160 hours and painted entirely freehand by one of the marque’s in-house artists, it depicts an ethereal interpretation of the Milky Way – the hazy band of stars and cosmic mist visible in the night sky – colour-graded to complement the Bespoke interior palette. To create the luminous cloud formations, the artist used more than 20 successive applications of acrylic paint, building depth and dimension with a variety of brushes. To achieve the mist effect, the artist turned to an unexpected tool – a makeup brush – to allow the lightest layer of pigments to dry delicately on contact. The shimmering field of painted ‘stars’ was formed using a combination of fine, pointed brushes and a speckling technique, giving the final composition an organic, celestial quality. Only once the painting on the Starlight Headliner was completed and sealed were the fibre-optic perforations individually punched and positioned by hand to complement the contours of the artwork. Cullinan Cosmos was commissioned through Private Office Dubai, one of a number of Rolls-Royce’s international Private Offices created to bring the full capabilities of the Bespoke Collective closer to the brand’s most visionary clients. Cullinan Cosmos was delivered to the commissioning family in time for a special occasion – ready to transform every journey into a voyage through the stars.

# BMW NA 50th Anniversary | 50 Stories for 50 Years [ADDRESS]: “The BMW Gallery: A Showcase for The Brand and Art” .

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To outsiders, Manhattan might not seem like much of a car market. Its streets are often gridlocked, and even when traffic is moving a car’s performance can feel largely irrelevant. And yet, a Manhattan location has been essential to any car maker’s success since the automobile was invented. It’s long been the center of both culture and capital, and each of its millions of inhabitants is a potential customer for a premium brand like BMW.

Despite the island’s importance, BMW of North America was underrepresented in Manhattan for the first decade after taking over sales and distribution from Max Hoffman in 1975. Hoffman’s own Park Avenue showrooms were either long gone or not included in the deal, and BMW’s sole dealer in Manhattan was a small and somewhat downscale operation that carried Volvo alongside BMW. BMW NA had been unsuccessful in its attempt to buy out the dealership, which was protected by franchise laws that also prevented BMW from opening an additional dealer in New York City.

Nothing could prevent BMW of North America from opening another kind of facility, however, one that wouldn’t sell cars but would cultivate a customer base more obliquely. “We couldn’t sell cars, but we wanted to have a nicer face in Manhattan,” said Tom McGurn, then BMW NA’s public relations manager. “Would we make that a typical showroom that wouldn’t sell cars but would refer customers to the dealership? Or would we make it more of a corporate statement?”

Under the leadership of Dr. Günther Kramer, who’d taken over as CEO from John Cook in 1983, BMW of North America had become a sophisticated operation. In its first decade, sales had increased nearly fivefold, and BMW had acquired an upwardly mobile gloss among US customers.

BMW AG and NA recognized the need to cultivate the premium and cultural aspects of the brand, and the BMW Gallery was the perfect solution. Three BMW Galleries were opened: one in Munich, another in Toronto, Canada, and one in New York City. The BMW Gallery would cater to BMW’s potential customer base not only by presenting BMW’s automobiles in an attractive and premium setting but by staging art exhibits like those its customers would seek out in galleries and museums throughout New York City. “Art was part of BMW’s overall values, and the BMW Gallery was consistent with that,” McGurn said.

Located at 320 Park Avenue, between 51st and 52nd Streets, the BMW Gallery opened in 1986 with a small exhibit followed by a major one. That November, the BMW Gallery presented “BMW & Five American Artists,” displaying five of the six BMW Art Cars created thus far. The BMW Art Car project had been initiated in 1975 by Parisian art dealer/racer Hervé Poulain, in cooperation with BMW Motorsport director Jochen Neerpasch, and had since become more of an Arts and Culture initiative by BMW AG. The BMW Art Car initiative had given prominent American artists (plus one Austrian, Ernst Fuchs) the opportunity to apply their work to a BMW race or road car.

The show at the BMW Gallery would feature the 3.0 CSL race cars painted by Alexander Calder and Frank Stella, the 320 [ADDRESS] racer by Roy Lichtenstein, the M1 Procar by Andy Warhol, and a roadgoing 635CSi by Robert Rauschenberg. Calder had died in 1976, but Stella and Lichtenstein were on hand for the opening, and so was Rauschenberg, whose Art Car was being shown to the public for the first time. “There was a rumor that people had seen Andy Warhol looking in through the windows, but not coming in,” McGurn said. “That may be a legend!”

The BMW Gallery hosted additional BMW Art Car exhibits over the years. In November 1990, the “BMW & Five Artists” exhibit was reprised, this time with a Group A E30 M3 race car painted by Australian artist Ken Done in place of the Rauschenberg 635CSi. The BMW Gallery also staged photography, painting, and video art exhibits that were unrelated to the BMW Art Car project.

“We had a huge video wall when those were pretty new,” McGurn said. “The type of art varied. We collaborated with the Mystic Seaport Museum on an exhibit of black and white photos of America’s Cup racing by the Rosenfeld brothers [Stanley, David, and William]. We also teamed up with the Southeast Center for Contemporary Art in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. They did a national juried show of contemporary art, and we became a sponsor. We mounted their annual show at the Gallery.”

BMW had long been a patron of the arts, and the BMW Gallery made that commitment highly visible in a well-trafficked part of Manhattan.

“It was a lovely ground-floor space on the corner of the building, with windows on two sides,” McGurn said. “It was a very bold corporate statement, and I think it was very successful.” In recent years, several upstart, and “re-boot” luxury vehicle brands have copied the BMW Gallery formula by setting up “brand houses” in Manhattan in an attempt raise brand awareness and reputation, but the BMW Gallery remains the original.

When the BMW Gallery’s lease ran out in 1998, BMW of North America declined to renew it. The space had fulfilled its two-fold mission, elevating the BMW brand and turning many of its visitors into BMW owners even while the marque remained under-represented in New York City. By the time the BMW Gallery closed, that situation had been rectified. BMW of North America had opened BMW Manhattan at 555 West 57th Street. This gleaming new dealership was wholly owned and operated by the company, with 228,000 square feet of floor space in which it could not only show but sell and service BMW automobiles.

Woodcliff Lake, NJ – [ADDRESS], 2025… Since its introduction in 2002, the BMW Z4 Roadster has been thrilling enthusiasts with its unique combination of classic proportions, a purist driving experience, and sporty dynamics. Today, BMW announces the Z4 Final Edition – a special Z4 M40i commmorating the end of production of the iconic 2-seat Roadster. The Z4 Final Edition will be characterized by its exclusive BMW Individual paint, unique interior accents, and commemorative badging on the door sill plates.

The BMW Z4 Final Edition will be produced in very small numbers from February to April of 2026 in a single, well-equipped configuration. Customers need only choose between a 6-speed manual or 8-speed Steptronic transmission. Regardless of transmission, the MSRP fo the Final Edition will be $77,500 plus $1,175 destination and handling.

Distinctive looks for an unmistakeable personality.

Fans will instantly recognize the BMW Z4 Final Edition by its exclusive BMW Individual Frozen Black metallic paint – a color that highlights the Z4’s unique design characteristics and dynamic flair. The special paint is subtly contrasted by the standard Shadowline Package, which adds high-gloss black trim to the mirror caps, kidney grill, lower air intake, air breathers, and exhaust finishers. The exterior design package of the Final Edition also incorporates a Moonlight Black soft top and red calipers on the standard M Sport brakes.

Every Z4 Final Edition is fitted with a staggered wheel and tire package. At the front, 19-inch M Dual-Spoke Bicolor 800M wheels are mounted on 255/35 R19 performance tires. At the back, 20-inch wheels are fitted with 285/30 R20 tires.

Customers who choose the 6-speed manual transmission will also receive the special chassis tuning developed for the Edition Handschalter Package. Enhancements include unique auxiliary springs at the front and rear axles and a specially reinforced anti-roll bar clamp fitted at the front. Both the mapping for electronic control of the rear dampers and the software for the variable sport steering are reconfigured. The traction control and M Sport differential also receive unique control logic.

Red accents in the interior.

The distinctive contrasting red stitching selected for the Z4 Final Edition provides a literal common thread that ties together the instrument panel, center console, door panels, and M Sport seats, which are trimmed in Vernasca Leather and Alcantara. The floor mats feature red piping and the special door sill plates are inscribed with “Z4 FINAL EDITION”. The seatbelts are trimmed in the M tricolor.

The Z4 Final Edition comes as standard with a full range of comfort, convenience, and safety features, including the Driving Assistance Package, Premium Package, and a Harman Kardon surround sound system.

The history of the BMW Z4: Launch of the first generation in 2002.

The BMW Z4 is part of a long tradition of open-top two‑seater sports cars. The lineage includes icons such as the BMW 328 Roadster, the BMW 507, and the BMW Z8.

The BMW Z4 had its premiere in autumn 2002, as the direct successor to the BMW Z3 launched in 1995. And, like its predecessor, the BMW roadster known internally as the E85 series was produced at the BMW Plant Spartanburg in South Carolina.

With its long hood and short trunk, the design of the BMW Z4 signalled power and sporting prowess. In the cabin, the low seating position just ahead of the rear axle made for a highly engaging driving experience. The BMW Z4 set new standards with a torsional stiffness previously unmatched in the convertible and roadster segment. Its supreme agility was due in large part to its 50/50 weight distribution. The BMW Z4 M Roadster was the first generation’s range-topper. Fitted with the 330 hp six-cylinder in-line engine from the BMW M3, it could accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in less than 5.0 seconds.

The second BMW Z4 generation: Unchanged dynamic appeal, electro-hydraulic retractable hardtop as standard.

In December 2008, BMW introduced the second generation of the Z4 to the world. The new two-seater, known internally as the E89, combined classic proportions with leading-edge engineering.

Perhaps the most intriguing feature of the new Z4 was the electro-hydraulically retractable hardtop made up of two roof sections. Featuring an aluminium shell design, the hardtop was included as standard and could be opened or closed at the touch of a button in just 20 seconds. With the hardtop in place, the BMW Z4 offered the refined comfort of a sporty premium coupé. The interior of the new BMW Z4 had gained much over the first-generation model in terms of headroom and elbow room. In addition, this marked the first time the roadster used the BMW iDrive infotainment system.

The third-generation BMW Z4: Modern interpretation of the classic open-top sports car.

BMW premiered the third – and current – generation of the BMW Z4 in August 2018 on the reviewing stand at the Lodge at Pebble Beach at the opening of Monterey Car Week. The BMW Z4 world premiere revealed a modern interpretation of the classic open-top sports car. A premium roadster boasting an electrically operated fabric softtop, sporty handling, and a purist, driver-focused interior design. This was complemented by premium-quality driver assistance, infotainment, and connectivity features. Unique in the segment is the three-liter straight-six engine with TwinPower Turbo technology found in the BMW Z4 M40i, which has been offered with a manual transmission since 2024 as the Edition Handschalter.

# The new 2026 BMW R 1300 RS.
## The BMW R 1300 RS: The new sports tourer with boxer engine, featuring refined technology and design, delivering a more dynamic riding experience.
Date: 2025-04-29 | Author: Oleg Satanovsky BMW Group | ID: T0449847EN_US
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Woodcliff Lake, NJ – [ADDRESS], 2025 . . . BMW Motorrad USA is proud to announce the new, sportier and more aggressive 2026 BMW R 1300 RS. The big boxer Sport Tourer returns with more power, more torque, more style, new technology and new options that allow each rider to tailor the extremely well balanced R 1300 RS to their specific desires and needs.

The low center of gravity and prodigious torque from the BMW boxer motor makes the new roadster an equally excellent companion for commuting, sport riding and touring.

“With the new BMW R 1300 RS, we’ve taken our sports touring bike with boxer engine to a whole new level. The motorcycle has been consistently designed with dynamic riding in mind. Thanks to an all-new engine, chassis and aerodynamic concept, it offers an even sportier riding experience than its predecessor. At the same time, it remains the perfect companion for comfortable touring and long-distance travel.”

Hauke Glässing, Project Manager BMW R 1300 RS

BMW R 1300 RS FEATURES

“The new BMW R 1300 RS has been given a far sportier character than its predecessor. This is evident not only in its increased engine performance and chassis capability, it is also instantly visible in the bike’s sporty design with fairing that extends a long way downwards. Accordingly, the ergonomics are now also noticeably sportier and more front-wheel-oriented – without compromising the typical BMW RS qualities of comfort for touring and long-distance travel.” Christian Hahn-Wörnle, Designer R 1300 RS

The new BMW R 1300 R: Noticeably sportier both technically and visually but with comfortable long distance capabilities.

The goal in developing the new BMW R 1300 RS was to give the sports touring boxer motorcycle a significantly sportier and more dynamic feel – both technically and visually.

The fuel tank’s dynamic flyline flows seamlessly into the sharply contoured front fairing with its distinctive headlights. The full fairing is visually broken up by functional technical cut-outs and recesses which showcase the aerodynamics of the new R 1300 RS. The model’s sportier character is further emphasized by the split-face design of the front end.

Despite the headlight’s added functionality with turning light, it appears noticeably smaller than its predecessor – giving it a more compact, sporty look. The low beam and turning lights are integrated while the high beam – barely visible – is positioned beneath the front fairing.

The aluminum die-cast rear frame complements the sporty character of the new R 1300 RS while retaining traditional RS touring capabilities, including useful luggage options. Thanks to its modular construction, the rear frame allows the bike to span the full range from stripped-back sports machine to comfortable touring motorcycle – with separate case holders and a variety of rear-end configurations, depending on individual preference and intended use, without compromising function or weight.

The aerodynamics also meet the demands of a true sports touring bike: during development, special emphasis was placed on the interplay between increased sportiness and the high level of wind and weather protection that is typical of RS models – all tested and refined in the wind tunnel. The optimized aerodynamics enhance performance, resulting in an increased top speed of 152 mph. This makes the R 1300 RS the fastest and sportiest model in the current boxer engine line-up.

Finally, the sporty, dynamic appearance of the new R 1300 RS is rounded off by numerous carefully crafted details, such as the two-part front fender and the concealed center cover.

Alongside its more aggressive, sportier design, equipment features such as the Performance variant – including a sport suspension, short, hand levers, milled and adjustable footrests, DTC-Shift, two additional sport screens, sport seat, engine spoiler and sport tires – allow customers to dial up the bike’s dynamic potential even further. At the same time, the BMW R 1300 RS remains a capable companion for everyday use and touring, and with options such as seat heating, Riding Assistant, a higher windscreen, and a variety of luggage choices, the bike can be perfectly tailored to individual needs of this type.

Perfect sporty ergonomics and equipment for dynamic sports touring – for one or two.

The BMW Motorrad designers set out to make the new BMW R 1300 RS significantly more dynamic and sportier than its predecessor, a goal the new Boxer roadster fulfills not only in terms of design, engine and chassis: equal importance was also placed on ergonomics, with a focus on creating a sportier, more active riding position.

Accordingly, the ergonomic triangle formed by the handlebars, footrests and seat of the new R 1300 R has been designed to position the rider noticeably further forward over the front wheel thanks to slightly rear set footrests and a flatter handlebar. This results in improved feedback from the front end, especially during sporty riding, and therefore greater controllability. At the same time, the sporty seating position still allows for relaxed touring and cruising, even with a passenger.

The handlebars are also around 1.4 inches wider than on the previous model. The optional comfort handlebars are positioned closer to the rider and set higher, resulting in a more relaxed riding position.

Further individual ergonomic adjustments are possible thanks to the footrest system with four-way adjustment, available on the Performance variant and as part of the range of Original BMW Motorrad Accessories.

A range of seat variants ensures an optimum seat height. Newly designed cases and a clever tank bag make the RS suitable for touring.

BMW Motorrad designers placed particular emphasis on optimum accessibility and a low seat height. For this reason, the development of the new R 1300 RS placed particular focus on achieving a seat height of 31.1 inches. In addition to the standard seat, the following are available as single optional extras.

For touring rides, the new BMW R 1300 RS can be fitted with a newly developed case system from the BMW Motorrad Original Accessories range, or with preparation for the luggage system fitted as optional equipment. The cases have a capacity of 26 and 29 liters respectively. Both are electrified and can be unlocked using the central locking system. They also both feature interior lighting, and the left-hand case includes a USB-C charging port. Additional storage is provided by the new optional topcase: this is also electrified, offers a capacity of 39 liters and includes a USB-C port.

Another accessory highlight in the new R 1300 RS is the new tank bag. For the first time, it is designed entirely without straps and is mounted on the motorcycle using a tank ring. A magnetic guide built into the tank ring makes fitting the tank bag especially easy.

The storage capacity can be expanded from 5 to 8 liters by means of a zipper. In addition, the tank bag features a rigid top and base and is UV-resistant. The rain cover that is included protects both the bag and its contents from moisture.

ENGINE AND DRIVETRAIN

“With significantly increased power and torque compared to its predecessor, the boxer engine in the new BMW R 1300 RS is the ideal drive for an even more dynamic sports touring experience – whether on country roads or on extended trips, even with a passenger and plenty of luggage.” Achim Baier, Vehicle Concept Manager BMW R 1300 RS

Boxer engine with increased power and torque along with optimized smoothness and efficiency.

The boxer engine in the new BMW R 1300 RS has a capacity of exactly 1,300 cc a bore and stroke of 106.5 mm x 73 mm (predecessor: 102.5 mm x 76 mm). This increase in capacity derives from an enlarged cylinder bore and a new crankshaft with reduced stroke. It has an output of 145 hp (predecessor: 136 hp), still at 7,750 rpm, and develops a maximum torque of 110 lb-ft. at 6,500 rpm (predecessor: 105 lb-ft at 6,250 rpm), making it by far the most powerful serial production BMW boxer engine to date. The maximum engine speed is 9,000 rpm.

The increased power and torque output makes the new R 1300 RS more potent and dynamic than ever before, combining enormous pulling power with impressive peak output. This applies to riding fun both solo and with a passenger, whether on sporty rides along winding roads or when going on tours.

It was also possible to optimize efficiency. Despite offering significantly more power and torque, the new BMW R 1300 RS consumes no more fuel than its predecessor. The boxer engine sets standards in terms of running smoothness, too, offering a more direct response to throttle commands thanks to reduced load reversal cycles in the powertrain. Ideal alignment of the engine-frame also ensures an exemplary vibration response.

The boxer engine in the new R 1300 RS uses an air/liquid cooling system where coolant flows through the engine elements that are subject to particular thermal stress, such as the cylinder heads. Other features that are retained include the vertical-flow cylinder heads, variable oil intake, effective piston base cooling and the DOHC valve gear with light cam followers. In the new boxer engine, the two camshafts are driven on each side of the cylinder by a timing chain running over both camshafts, each from a reduction sprocket. On the right-hand side, the drive is located in front of the cylinder, while on the left-hand side, the timing chain duct is arranged behind the cylinder. Furthermore, the engine of the new BMW R 1300 RS feature, the tried-and-tested knock sensor system and BMS-O engine management for highly effective combustion.

The new boxer engine compresses the fuel-air mixture at a ratio of 13.3:1 (predecessor: 12.5:1). The gain in power and torque with high efficiency is also due to recalculated timing and larger valve diameters: these now measure 44 mm instead of 40 mm on the inlet side and 35.6 mm instead of 34 mm on the outlet side.

More compact, lighter engine/gearbox packaging, new drive shaft drive and new rear hub.

[ADDRESS]-speed gearbox and clutch are integrated into the engine housing, not behind the engine but underneath it. The advantages of this new arrangement lie in a reduced overall length and in improved packaging and weight balance, since it was possible to make the transmission shafts significantly shorter. Compared to the 1,250 cc power unit of the predecessor models, it was possible to achieve a weight saving of 8.6 lbs. for the basic engine and 14.3 lbs. for the entire powertrain. At the same time, an even greater concentration of mass towards the overall center of gravity ensures better handling qualities. As before, power is transmitted to the 6-speed gearbox via a ten-disk wet clutch with a self-reinforcing anti-hopping mechanism. Output is via two spur gears, one of which has an integrated vibration damper.

In the interests of increased shifting precision, the gearbox now has a sensor signal transmitter based on a torsion magnet instead of a metal spring. In combination with Gear Shift Assist Pro, this results in a much more direct feel when changing gear.

The driveshaft now has larger universal joints, while a decrease in angle reduces the deflection of the rotational transmission that is inherent in drive shaft joints. The rear axle hub has a longer wheel axle stub for easier mounting and dismounting of the rear wheel.

BMW ShiftCam technology for superior performance, smoothness and efficiency.

The boxer engine of the new BMW R 1300 RS is equipped with the unique BMW ShiftCam technology for varying the valve timing and valve stroke on the intake side. At the heart of this technology is a single-section intake shift camshaft which has a partial-load and a full-load cam for each valve to be actuated, each with a different cam geometry. While the partial-load cam has been configured to ensure optimized fuel consumption and refinement, the full-load cam is designed for optimized output.

The intake cams for the left and right-hand intake valves of the partial-load cam differ in stroke and angular position. This phase shift means that the two intake valves are opened to different degrees and on a time-staggered basis. The effect of this is to create a swirl effect and therefore greater agitation of the fuel-air mixture flowing into the combustion chamber. As a result, the new BMW R 1300 R benefits from even more effective combustion.

Lightweight stainless steel exhaust system delivers optimum performance.

[ADDRESS]-into-1 exhaust system of the new R 1300 RS is made entirely of stainless steel. It is designed for optimum output and torque in conjunction with the BMW ShiftCam technology and for very low weight. It enables a very homogeneous output and torque curve, thereby ensuring the best possible rideability and performance. Exhaust gasses are taken care of by a closed-loop catalytic converter controlled by an oxygen sensor. In this way, the new R 1300 RS complies not just with current exhaust standards, but is equipped to meet future requirements, too.

Three standard riding modes allow the bike to adapt to any road conditions.

The new R 1300 RS has three standard riding modes for adaptation to individual rider preferences. The “RAIN” and “ROAD” riding modes allow riding characteristics to be adapted to most road conditions. The “ECO” riding mode makes it possible to use the innovative BMW ShiftCam technology to achieve maximum range from a single tank of fuel. In this riding mode, a gentle throttle curve and moderate torque limitation promote a riding style that is as economical as possible. In order to provide visual support for a riding style geared towards optimized fuel consumption, an efficiency indicator in the upper status line of the TFT color screen provides feedback when “ECO” mode is activated. If maximum performance is required – e.g. on gradients or when overtaking – it is simple to quickly switch to another riding mode using the riding mode button.

Riding Modes Pro with the additional modes “DYNAMIC” and “DYNAMIC PRO”.

The new R 1300 RS can be fitted with the optional Riding Modes Pro, which adds two additional riding modes - “DYNAMIC” and “DYNAMIC PRO”.

At least two and a maximum of four riding modes can be chosen from a list in the settings menu, and these can be selected successively using the riding mode button. This offers a wide range of options for configuring the new R 1300 RS to suit the rider’s personal needs. In this way, a preferred and easily manageable number of riding modes can be configured and selected while riding.

Standard MSR Engine Drag Torque Control is used to help avoid unstable riding conditions that can occur during coasting or downshifting due to excessive brake slip at the rear wheel. In these cases, MSR instantly opens the throttle valves to such an extent that drag torque is equalized and the motorcycle stabilizes.

The control response depends on the riding mode. In “ECO”, “RAIN” and “ROAD” riding modes, MSR ensures maximum ride stability, whereas “DYNAMIC” and “DYNAMIC PRO” modes allow for more slip.

Standard DTC Dynamic Traction Control and optional DTC-Shift function available as part of Style Performance.

Standard DTC Dynamic Traction Control uses fixed base settings to control rear wheel slip in “RAIN”, “ROAD” and “ECO” riding modes. In “DYNAMIC PRO” mode – included in the new R 1300 RS Style Performance – fine adjustment via DTC-Shift (+/– shift) is available. To put it simply, this function allows the length of the black line to be adjusted when accelerating out of a corner.

Available ASA Automatic Shift Assistant with fully automated clutch operation and manual or automated shifting for an enhanced motorcycling experience.

With ASA Automatic Shift Assistant, BMW Motorrad offers an innovative technical solution to make motorcycling easier and more comfortable. True to the motto “Simplify your Ride”, automated clutch operation and gear changes puts the riding experience even more front and center – without sacrificing the emotionally important dynamic of the shifting process.

ASA features two electromechanical actuators to automate clutching and shifting in the conventional 6-speed gearbox – the key difference from a conventional shift assistant. As a result, there is no need for a clutch lever for manual operation. Starting, stopping and maneuvering are effortless.

ASA also enhances the actual riding experience with quick gearshifts which are appropriate to the load and engine speed, and the resulting precise gear changes. The rider workload is thus reduced, resulting in greater riding enjoyment. ASA also creates a more direct connection to the boxer engine, as the precise clutch actuation makes it easier to control the ride using the throttle and gear lever.

In shift mode “M”, gears can still be changed manually using the foot lever, allowing the rider to choose the exact shift point. ASA really comes into its own when using shift mode “D”: here, perfectly timed gear changes with smooth torque interruption deliver efficient acceleration and greater ride stability. When shifting up, for instance, the usual jolt associated with a manual gearbox is largely eliminated, reducing the risk of helmet-to-helmet contact between rider and passenger.

Downshifts are also carried out with maximum smoothness, minimizing any disruption to the chassis. In order to ensure optimal gear shifting for each riding situation, different riding modes are assigned specific characteristics of the automated shifting function. And when used in conjunction with Cruise Control or Frontal Collision Warning, the networking of functions brings the future of motorcycling within reach.

Benefits offered by ASA Automatic Shift Assistant:

CHASSIS AND SUSPENSION

“The new BMW R 1300 RS is the most powerful sports touring bike with boxer engine that has ever been built. Its performance comes not only from the punchy engine but also from an extremely compact design and a clear focus on riding dynamics. The sports suspension in the R 1300 RS Performance also provides increased banking freedom and a firmer damping set-up for particularly sporty rides.” Markus Klein, Project Manager Riding Dynamics BMW R 1300 RS

Newly developed chassis with steel main and aluminum rear frames.

The chassis of the new BMW R 1300 RS has been completely redesigned. The centerpiece is the new sheet steel main frame, which in addition to a significant space optimization for even more compact packaging, also offers higher levels of stiffness than the predecessor model. In the course of the redesign, the rear frame was also completely reconceived. In place of the previous tubular steel construction, the new R 1300 RS now has a rear frame made of die-cast aluminum. In addition to excellent stiffness levels and low weight, this new solution also has advantages in terms of optimized installation space as well as offering a high degree of freedom for innovative design. For example, a short, slim rear end in the new R 1300 RS forms a significantly stiffer bond with the main frame compared to its predecessor. This results in a noticeable increase in riding precision and stability.

In combination with a much more compact drivetrain, the new design of the chassis achieved a significant concentration of mass towards the overall center of gravity, which is reflected in noticeable handling benefits. At the same time, the new R 1300 RS is even more precise and stable when braking, requires noticeably less effort to ride, and offers a more satisfyingly precise response of the suspension components.

New upside-down telescopic fork, new EVO Paralever II rear suspension, and lighter wheels.

The BMW R 1300 RS features a new 47 mm upside-down telescopic fork with 5.5 inches of suspension travel. The redesigned rear suspension is built around the Evo Paralever II, with its significantly stiffer connection to the frame and a continuous swinging arm quick-release axle. In addition, the swing arm bearing is now arranged off-axis to the axis of rotation of the drive shaft joint. The rear suspension travel is 5.1 inches.

The new R 1300 RS also features new 17-inch aluminum cast wheels with a hollow-spoke design. They weigh a combined 3.0 lbs. less than the previous wheels. The reduced rotational mass results in both improved acceleration and brake response as well as optimized handling qualities. Wheel sizes are 3.5 x 17” front and 6.0 x 17” rear, mounted with 120/70 ZR 17 and 190/55 ZR 17 tires, respectively.

New optional (DSA) electronic Dynamic Suspension Adjustment plus the world’s first series production motorcycle telescopic fork with adjustable spring rate.

The standard Dynamic ESA electronic suspension offers a high level of riding safety and fun on a wide variety of terrains with its dynamic adjustment of the damping and adjustable rear spring pre-load.

The optional electronic Dynamic Suspension Adjustment now goes one step further, combining the dynamic adjustment of the front and rear damping with a corresponding adjustment of the spring rate (spring stiffness) – depending on the selected riding mode, riding conditions and dynamic maneuvers. In addition to the recently announced BMW R 1300 R, this makes the new BMW R 1300 RS the first series production motorcycles with an upside-down telescopic fork that allows adjustment of the spring rate. Automatic load compensation is provided by the adjustable spring pre-load.

This makes for an even more thrilling riding experience on all surfaces. Whether solo, with a passenger or with luggage – DSA ensures an even higher level of riding safety, performance and comfort. With DSA, the rider benefits from more refined handling. DSA also significantly simplifies usability due to even more integration with the different riding modes. The riding modes can be individualized by means of click-setting in the vehicle settings menu, offering a wealth of options for customizing the new R 1300 RS to suit personal preferences. DSA also includes a “prop-up aid” function, making it easier to raise the bike onto the optionally available center stand.

Sports suspension exclusive to the R 1300 R Style Performance.

The sports suspension fitted exclusively to the R 1300 RS Style Performance variant gives the dynamic roadster an even greater sporting edge. Here, the DSA suspension was further developed with a longer upside-down fork at the front and a longer rear shock. This allows for greater ground clearance and lean angles. In addition, firmer damping provides greater stability and gives the rider more precise feedback. The sport suspension increases ground clearance, thereby raising seat height by around 0.4 inches.

High-performance braking system with standard ABS Pro and optional Sport Brake.

The new R 1300 R comes standard with a twin 310 mm disc brake featuring two radially mounted four-piston fixed calipers at the front and a single 285 mm disc brake with two-piston floating caliper at the rear in conjunction with BMW Motorrad Fully Integral ABS Pro. Here, the handbrake and footbrake levers both activate the front and rear brakes simultaneously. Fully Integral ABS Pro is optimized for the respective purpose by means of an additional set-up that depends on the riding mode. In the Fully Integral ABS Pro settings, it is possible to lock the rear wheel via the foot brake lever.

As a back-up system to Fully Integral ABS Pro, Dynamic Brake Control (DBC) offers increasedsafety when braking in difficult situations – by preventing unintentional throttle application. By means of intervention in the engine control unit, the drive torque is reduced during braking, making full use of the braking power at the rear wheel. This keeps the motorcycle stable and shortens the braking distance.

The new BMW R 1300 RS Style Performance variant is also fitted with the Sport Brake system as part of the package. In addition to a sportier look with titanium-colored brake calipers, it offers a slight increase in braking performance.

ELECTRONICS

“The new full LED headlight in a very slim, sporty design gives the new BMW R 1300 RS a distinctive front profile and highlights its more distinct sporty character. With the Riding Assistant featuring Active Cruise Control (ACC) and Front Collision Warning (FCW), major new features are also available as optional equipment for added safety and comfort.” Matthias Hillebrand, Product Manager BMW R 1300 RS

Standard full LED headlight and state-of-the-art LED lighting throughout.

BMW Motorrad is regarded as the pioneer when it comes to motorcycling safety and related innovations. Accordingly, the new R 1300 RS comes standard with a newly designed twin-chamber LED headlight in a very slim, sporty design featuring a distinctive light icon. This illuminates the road with unrivalled clarity, thereby ensuring better perception in traffic. The lighting unit comprises two LED elements for the low beam and two additional, separately positioned LED elements for the high beam. State-of-the-art LED light units with newly designed LED turn indicators round off the lighting design of the new R 1300 RS.

With the optional Headlight Pro, the dipped beam of the standard full LED headlight is optimized for cornering, depending on the lean angle, by activating additional LED elements. In this way, the turn is almost fully illuminated because the light moves to where the motorcycle is heading. By optimizing the light pattern, the low beam light ensures an even wider and more homogeneous illumination of the road.

The function is activated when the engine is running, the high or low beam is activated and darkness is detected, from road speeds of approx. 6 mph and a banking angle of the motorcycle of approx. 7°. The additional lighting is highly effective up to a banking angle of approx. 25°. What is more, the adaptive turning light segment is activated in a dimmed state. The greater the banking angle, the brighter the segment becomes. This function significantly improves illumination when cornering.

Optional Riding Assistant with Active Cruise Control (ACC) and Frontal Collision Warning (FCW) for safe and comfortable motorcycling.

The new BMW R 1300 RS can be equipped with the Riding Assistant for safer and more comfortable motorcycling. This includes Active Cruise Control (ACC) and Frontal Collision Warning (FCW).

Active Cruise Control (ACC) enables maximum comfort and the best possible safety when riding: the electronic cruise control with integrated distance control can be used to set the desired riding speed as well as the distance to the vehicle in front. A radar sensor at the front of the motorcycle determines the distance to the vehicle ahead based on the yaw rate and vehicle speed. If this distance decreases, the system reduces speed and automatically restores the desired distance. This frees the mind for carefree riding fun, ensuring a relaxed ride, especially on long tours.

Frontal Collision Warning (FCW) with brake intervention is designed to provide protection from collisions and help reduce the severity of accidents. Frontal Collision Warning uses the ACC radar system to provide protection from frontal collisions. The rider assistance system can warn of potential collisions with other vehicles, or cyclists and preconditions the brakes.

For the first time, GPS Prep now features electric locking for maximum comfort.

The optional GPS Prep feature allows quick and secure attachment and operation of a navigation device or smartphone using a cradle mount. For the first time, this mount no longer requires a physical key – it unlocks electrically for maximum convenience. The new GPS Prep allows use of the BMW Motorrad [ADDRESS] to 6, the ConnectedRide Navigator and the ConnectedRide Cradle.

Optional seat heating for rider and passenger.

In addition to the optionally available heated grips, the new seat heating for rider and passenger provides comforting warmth on colder days – for a more enjoyable riding experience. Seat heating for the rider is available with all seat height options, while passenger seat heating is only available in combination with the Comfort passenger seat.

[ADDRESS] power and USB-C sockets.

The new BMW R 1300 RS comes standard with two different types of sockets. A 12-volt onboard power socket is installed on the right-hand side near the passenger footrest pin. In addition, a USB-C socket with 5-volt supply is located on the left-hand side of the cockpit. It delivers up to 2,400 mA of charging current (normal level: 1,200 mA), enabling fast charging depending on smartphone type. A USB adapter cable is available as an accessory item and is equipped with sturdy kink protection.

The external and easily accessible socket is designed to be short-circuit-proof and is protected from overvoltage. Thanks to the integrated sealing cap, it is also effectively protected against the environment.

Connectivity: Multifunctional instrument cluster with 6.5-inch full-color TFT screen.

The new R 1300 RS features standard Connectivity, including a 6.5-inch full-color TFT screen. In conjunction with the standard BMW Motorrad Multi-Controller, it gives the rider fast access to vehicle and connectivity functions.

This means it is possible to conveniently make a phone call or listen to music during travel. If a smartphone and a helmet with the BMW Motorrad Communication System are connected via Bluetooth to the TFT screen, for example, the rider can conveniently access media playback and telephone functions. These functions can also be used without the need to install an app. With an active Bluetooth connection to any standard smartphone, the rider can enjoy the pleasures of listening to music during travel. In addition, the BMW Motorrad Connected App offers handy arrow-based navigation suitable for day-to-day use directly via the TFT screen. The BMW Motorrad Connected App can be downloaded free of charge from the Google and Apple app stores. It also includes additional functions such as route logging and the display of other travel information. The basic navigation system will be of particular interest to motorcyclists since it enables convenient organization of day-to-day travel and short trips without the need for additional equipment.

Standard Intelligent Emergency Call for increased safety.

Ensuring the fastest possible assistance in the event of an accident or in situations of emergency and danger can save people’s lives. For this reason, BMW Motorrad has developed an eCall system – “Intelligent Emergency Call” – which aims to get help to the scene of the incident as quickly as possible.

# BMW Group’s home plant gears up for NEUE KLASSE
## +++ Pre-series production to begin this summer +++ Lower manufacturing costs for NEUE KLASSE +++ Production Head Nedeljković: “Production network's strategic and flexible structure strengthens resilience and competitiveness” +++ Over one million cars built in Germany in 2024 +++
Date: 2025-03-05 | Author: Susanne Tsitsinias BMW Group | ID: T0448435EN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Munich. BMW Group Plant Munich is gearing up to launch the NEUE KLASSE in summer 2026. During ongoing series operation, three new production halls are currently being built for the body shop, assembly and associated production logistics. “For the production start of the NEUE KLASSE, we will have a state-of-the-art plant in Munich that is characterised by flexibility, innovation and, above all, efficiency,” says Plant Director Peter Weber.

Starting in 2027, the plant in Munich will exclusively produce fully-electric vehicles, further enhancing efficiency boost. Forward planning, close cooperation with development teams and suppliers, and the integration of modern production technology within new structures will all play a key role. “With the NEUE KLASSE, we will significantly reduce manufacturing costs at the Munich Plant,” says Weber. In addition to optimised production processes and targeted automation, the NEUE KLASSE’s new vehicle architecture will also leverage further efficiencies. Focusing on a single drive train variant reduces production steps and the number of parts – for example, for wiring harnesses, which previously varied according to engine type and can be complex to install.

Unusual process: Pre-series production at pilot plant The timeline for the ramp-up in Munich is carefully synchronised – in part due to the plant’s refurbishment. The first pre-series vehicles will be built at the pilot plant of the BMW Group Research and Innovation Centre (FIZ), with support from Plant Munich’s production team, before the end of the year. “Alongside the pilot plant at the FIZ, we are also using virtual simulations to ensure a smooth ramp-up,” says Weber, describing the unusual situation in the decisive year ahead of the launch. He adds that Plant Munich’s experienced launch team is also working closely with colleagues at the new plant in Debrecen, Hungary, where the first NEUE KLASSE model will enter production late this year.

International production network: Cooperation, flexibility and innovative processes BMW Group plants are capable of producing different model variants and drive train types on a single line. Since the ramp-up of electromobility is not linear and will progress at varying speeds, the company has relied on “flex-plants”, which can manufacture vehicles with both internal combustion engines and electric drive trains. “In this way, we can ensure our delivery capabilities in different market situations and maintain good capacity utilisation at our locations,” explains Milan Nedeljković, member of the Board of Management responsible for Production.

By the end of the decade, the BMW Group expects a significant increase in the market shares of fully-electric vehicles. For this reason, the plants in Debrecen and, later, Munich will be the first facilities dedicated exclusively to fully-electric vehicles, enhancing electrification capacities throughout the network.

The German plants lead the way on e-mobility in the BMW Group’s production network: Alongside traditional drive technologies, each of them builds at least one fully-electric model for the global market. Even in a volatile environment, the BMW Group continues to grow its domestic locations, manufacturing over a million vehicles there last year – accounting for a quarter of Germany's total automotive production.

At the same time, the company’s production also depends on a balanced global distribution of value creation. “The strategic and flexible structure of our production network strengthens our resilience and makes us more competitive,” adds Nedeljković.

Focus on employees: Developing skills for e-mobility The shift towards electrified vehicles also brings changes to employee roles and required skills. With the flexible ramp-up of e-mobility at BMW Group plants, employees can gradually be prepared for new job content.

“Despite technical and structural innovations, our focus is always on people. We take pride in our employees’ expertise and experience, and their dedication to continuous improvement. It is thanks to their commitment that we are able to consistently deliver premium-quality vehicles,” emphasises Weber. Additional expertise will be developed and retained at the company through extensive further training and workforce flexibility. Last year alone, nearly 25,000 employees completed e-mobility training. Plant Munich is currently holding its third industrial electrician qualification course, conducted in cooperation with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK).

In recent years, around 5,500 jobs have been created across the BMW Group production network for the current and upcoming generation of e-drives. More than three quarters of these positions were filled through internal reorganisation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Munich. BMW Customer Service has its customers’ backs. The new “Relax. We Care.” campaign showcases this aspect with a quirky sense of humour. It is now available to view on social media.

Anything that can go wrong will go wrong – and this is also the theme of the new short film for the annual BMW Customer Service campaign. “The Thief” is a story about a marriage proposal and a thief, with all kinds of surprising twists and turns. Larger than life, told with tongue firmly in cheek, and great attention to detail.

As in the previous films “The Park” ( BMW Group on YouTube ) and “The Storm” ( BMW Group on YouTube ), the BMW as the silent protagonist suffers plenty of indignities. Scratches, dents, shattered glass and broken-off parts are the visible result of these unexpected adventures. Just as well the professionals from BMW Service and Original BMW Parts are there to repair the damage and bring the claim “Relax. We Care.” to life.

The “Relax. We Care.” campaign was produced by the digital agency Monks. The short film “The Thief” is available to view from 19 March at [EXTERNAL_RESOURCE]

On its trip to Barcelona, the new MINI Cooper Convertible shines in the elegant shade of Copper Grey. The convertible-specific metallic paint glistens in the Spanish sun. Thanks to the sunroof function and the ability to fully open the fully automatic roof at speeds of up to 30 km/h in just 18 seconds, a unique open-air experience is guaranteed. The roof folds compactly, providing comfortable storage space in the trunk of 160 liters even when folded. When the roof is closed, this increases to 215 liters. The integrated "Always-Open Timer" counts the moments of fresh air travelled with the roof down on the round central instrument.

The MINI Cooper Convertible S is powered by an efficient 4-cylinder petrol engine with 150 kW/204 hp. This allows the MINI Cooper Convertible to reach a top speed of 237 km/h.

Laguna Seca. The impressive streak in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship (IWSC) continued at Laguna Seca (USA). Dries Vanthoor (BEL) in the BMW M Team RLL #24 BMW M Hybrid V8 once again was the fastest man in qualifying. He claimed his and teammate Philipp Eng’s (AUT) fourth pole position in as many races this season. In the race itself, the #24 car battled for victory right up to the end and secured third place after a dramatic finish. This marks the second podium of the IMSA season for Vanthoor/Eng, following their result at Long Beach (USA). In the #25 BMW M Hybrid V8, Marco Wittmann (GER) and Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) also delivered a strong performance, taking fourth place – their best result of the season so far.

At the start of the two-hour and 40-minute race, Vanthoor maintained the lead and held a several-second advantage over the field for the first 50 minutes. Only when lapped traffic began to factor in were the chasing cars able to close the gap, kicking off a tight battle for the top three. After a late first pit stop, Eng rejoined the race in third place with car #24. Both he and later Vanthoor managed to stay close to the leading two Porsches. In a tense and uninterrupted final phase without any full course yellows to neutralise the field, the outcome remained wide open. Vanthoor was only a few tenths of a second behind in third place, waiting for his opportunity to attack. In a dramatic fight for the win, he was touched in the final corner and spun off the track. Nonetheless, Vanthoor was able to get the #24 car going again and cross the finish line in third.

In the sister car #25, van der Linde and Wittmann also confirmed the competitiveness of the BMW M Hybrid V8. Starting from sixth on the grid, they pursued an alternate strategy and made an early first pit stop, which initially dropped them further down the field. However, after around 90 minutes of racing, Wittmann climbed from seventh to fourth within just a few laps. The #25 ultimately crossed the line right behind its sibling car, rounding off a strong showing for BMW M Team RLL with fourth place.

The BMW M4 GT3 EVO crews faced a tough race at Laguna Seca. In the GTD-Pro class, Dan Harper (GBR) and Max Hesse (GER) took fifth place in the #48 car from Paul Miller Racing. Their teammates Madison Snow and Neil Verhagen (both USA) were tenth in the #1 car. In the GTD class, the #96 BMW M4 GT3 EVO from Turner Motorsport, driven by Robby Foley and Patrick Gallagher (both USA), finished ninth.

Comments after the race:

Andreas Roos, Head of BMW M Motorsport: “The race weekend at Laguna Seca confirmed that we’ve continued to close the gap and are now fighting for top positions with the performance of our BMW M Hybrid V8. Dries Vanthoor taking the fourth consecutive pole position was sensational. Sheldon van der Linde in car #25 was also quick and secured sixth place in a very tight qualifying session. Both cars delivered a strong performance in the race as well. In a race shaped in part by strategy, the team and drivers executed a flawless collective effort. It was extremely intense right up to the final corner, and we were fighting for the win. In the end, Dries Vanthoor and Philipp Eng secured their second consecutive podium, and Sheldon van der Linde and Marco Wittmann achieved their best result of the season so far with fourth place, finishing right behind. The trend is clearly upward, and now we’ll continue working hard to take that final step and reward everyone’s hard work with a victory.”

Dries Vanthoor (#24 BMW M Hybrid V8, BMW M Team RLL, 3rd place): “I think P3 was almost the maximum we could have achieved today. The Porsches were again strong but we had a good race, the team did a great job. We did the best we could. That I was pushed off in the last corner was unfortunate. It was a racing incident, even though I think it was unnecessary. We still have work to do but having had two podiums in two races is a very nice achievement, but we just want more after the qualifying achievements and win a race.”

Philipp Eng (#24 BMW M Hybrid V8, BMW M Team RLL, 3rd place): “It was a very exciting race and a very good weekend overall. Qualifying again was great from Dries and the entire team. The race was tricky but good fun. P3 is another good result but of course we wanted to get the victory. We had the pace and the package but in the end it didn’t quite work out. We will just work harder from here. Thanks to the whole team.”

Marco Wittmann (#25 BMW M Hybrid V8, BMW M Team RLL, 4th place): “It was a difficult weekend for us, we had some issues in FP2 and qualifying. We tried to fix them for the race but went a bit blind into the race. Nevertheless we made some good progress, gained a couple of positions, had some good fights and good fun out there. Obviously the aim was to step on the podium which was not in our reach here though. We were lacking the pace a bit which we have to investigate. Still we can be fairly happy with how the race went and with P4 considering how the weekend went. Now we need to look into the data and find some performance for the next races. Then the aim is to bring both cars on the podium and ideally chase the win.”

# Ultimate Endurance Test: MINI John Cooper Works and Bulldog Racing once again take on the 24 Hours Race at the Nürburgring.
## After a successful win at last years race, MINI John Cooper Works will again participate in the 24 Hours Race at the Nürburgring in 2025 together with Bulldog Racing. An exclusive vehicle design in collaboration with the apparel and lifestyle brand Deus Ex Machina will adorn the MINI John Cooper Works on the racetrack.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Munich. MINI John Cooper Works will compete again at this year's 53rd edition of the 24 Hours race at the Nürburgring. Last year, MINI achieved a spectacular triumph in the SP-3T class of the race with the near-production #317 MINI John Cooper Works Pro. The so-called "Green Hell" offers one of the toughest tests in motorsport with fast straights, demanding curves, and significant elevation changes. The successful cooperation with the Bulldog Racing Team will also continue this year.

MINI x DEUS: Spectacular Appearance. At the starting line of this year's race, the MINI John Cooper Works will attract attention with a specially designed livery, while the Bulldog Racing Team will be exclusively dressed in the brands new season collection. The partnership is a glimpse into something the two brands MINI x DEUS are building toward.

"Our models have always been characterised by the combination of design and dynamics. Our MINI John Cooper Works, which will compete in the 24 Hours race at the Nürburgring, takes this combination to the next level: Thanks to this collaboration with Deus Ex Machina, we are setting new, exciting impulses for MINI fans and motorsport enthusiasts. Both brands are characterised by creativity and attention to detail, which allows the creation of exclusive designs with a distinctly individual style," explains Stefan Richmann, Head of MINI.

Racing DNA meets exclusive design. For this year's 24 Hours race at the Nürburgring, the high-performance orientation of MINI John Cooper Works is combined with the passion and craftsmanship of Deus Ex Machina. The design team has pursued a consistent black and white approach in the design of the vehicle livery. The enlarged "DEUS" logo dominates the design as a graphic element and becomes more than just a wordmark. The unconventional, playful handling of the brand presence is typical of DEUS and gives the MINI 24 Hours race car its visual identity this year. The reduced black and white color scheme ensures that additional elements such as starting numbers or team logos are harmoniously integrated into the overall image. Hand-drawn logos on windows and other surfaces underline the raw, conceptual character of the race car, making it appear like a "moving sketchbook". This is intended to suggest that the Nürburgring 24 Hours race car is just a foretaste. It is the perfect first milestone in the MINI x DEUS cooperation.

For the design of the race car livery, MINI Design collaborated with Designworks. The BMW Group subsidiary has elaborated the creative idea of DEUS in detail. "Successful brand collaborations arise when partners inspire and drive each other forward. With DEUS, MINI and Designworks, we were able to unleash a remarkable design dynamic. The DEUS livery of the MINI John Cooper Works at the 24-hour race at the Nürburgring is just the first proof of this," says Holger Hampf, Head of MINI Design.

MINI Continues Its Racing Heritage. With its appearance, MINI is continuing its long-standing racing heritage. The brand has been considered an underdog in motorsports from the very beginning - and yet it has written motorsport history. The 1964 Monte Carlo Rally became a shining moment for the British Outsider. With its transversely mounted front engine and front-wheel drive, the classic Mini was the epitome of a practical small car - and proved to be a successful race car thanks to the ingenious racing engineer John Cooper. The victory in the Monte Carlo Rally was not a mere whim of fate, but the result of meticulous work. This was followed by two more victories in the famous rally in 1965 and 1967. The tradition and passion for MINI's racing heritage is still palpable and tangible in the current models. The latest MINI John Cooper Works models are characterised by their aerodynamic precision and performance-oriented four-cylinder TwinPower Turbo petrol engine.

# Focus on digitalization: BMW Group strengthens production logistics and financial processes with modern SAP architecture
## +++ Digital production logistics to go live in four plants by year-end +++ New financial data model accelerates analysis and control +++ Cloud-based SAP solutions increase efficiency and enable AI usage +++
Date: 2025-06-03 | Author: Benedikt Fischer BMW Group | ID: T0450529EN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Munich. With the introduction of pioneering SAP applications, the BMW Group is making significant progress in digitalization. The successful projects in production logistics and finance mark important milestones in the Group-wide rollout of a new, cloud-based IT architecture. Developed as greenfield projects, these solutions were created from scratch and are now being gradually rolled out worldwide.

"With the next stage of digitalization in production logistics and finance – enabled by consistent, unified data structures and standard process templates – we have significantly advanced the AI enablement of the BMW Group," explains Alexander Buresch, CIO and Senior Vice President of BMW Group IT. "As part of our partnership with SAP, we have transferred key corporate processes to a service-oriented, cloud-based platform, achieving a new level of efficiency, quality, and automation."

Global Digitalization of Production Logistics

So far, in addition to the MINI plant in Oxford, the high-volume plant in Regensburg has been successfully converted to digital production logistics. By the end of the year, the Munich headquarters and the new plant in Debrecen, Hungary, will follow. The latter will begin producing the fully electric BMW iX3 – the first model of the Neue Klasse – by year-end.

The so-called “Parts Process Chain” enables digital control of all in-house produced components and parts sourced from external suppliers, and is being gradually introduced at all production sites worldwide as part of the BMW iFactory. Optimized collaboration with suppliers, as well as efficient storage and provision, ensures stable operations and flexible control of the entire production process.

"The global digitalization of our production logistics significantly increases transparency and standardization, allowing us to respond more quickly to changes in demand or supply shortages," explains Michael Nikolaides, Head of Production Network and Logistics at the BMW Group. "In addition to vehicle plants, we will also integrate new assembly sites for sixth-generation high-voltage batteries to support the stable ramp-up of electromobility."

New Financial Solution Improves Data Transparency and Process Efficiency

The financial system "Group Finance BackBone" (GFBB) features a completely new data model that standardizes previously heterogeneously structured financial information. This leads to improved data comparability and higher granularity, enabling detailed analyses and real-time business management. "We call it ‘data at your fingertips,’ as time-consuming manual evaluations and complex reconciliations are now a thing of the past," explains Jonathan Townend, Head of Group Reporting and Taxes at the BMW Group.

Moreover, GFBB ensures comprehensive standardization and harmonization of financial processes across the Group. It takes into account both central and local requirements and significantly increases the degree of automation in finance. For the organization, this means easier cross-functional collaboration and a notable reduction in complexity. Following the successful go-live of BMW AG, BMW Bank, and the production plants in Oxford and Debrecen, the global rollout of GFBB is now continuing step by step.

Strategic Partnership with SAP

As part of the “RISE with SAP” initiative, the BMW Group launched a comprehensive transformation process back in 2023. The goal is to migrate existing SAP systems to a modern, cloud-based architecture that also facilitates greater use of AI. The intelligent combination of SAP standards and BMW Cloud Services ensures rapid integration of innovations, maximum flexibility, and global scalability. Additionally, the BMW Group is actively involved in the further development of the SAP S/4HANA standard and drives it forward through co-innovation efforts.

Woodcliff Lake, NJ – [ADDRESS], 2025… BMW is the first automotive manufacturer to launch a completely newly developed digital nervous system for all drivetrain variants and vehicle segments. It is more intelligent, more powerful and more efficient and will be rolled out for the first time in the models of the Neue Klasse. Four high-performance computers, also called "Superbrains", consolidate the computing power for the most important customer functions: infotainment, automated driving, driving dynamics, and basic functions such as vehicle access, climate control, and comfort. The four Superbrains provide more than 20 times the computing power compared to the current vehicle generation and are already designed for upcoming software and function updates, including AI-powered customer experiences.

"Technology openness is the key to BMW's success. Starting with the first model of the Neue Klasse, we will roll out the technologies of the Neue Klasse across the entire future model portfolio – across all segments and all drivetrains. This also applies to our completely newly developed electronic architecture made up of powerful 'Superbrains' and highly interconnected software platforms. This architecture allows us to decouple the development of the vehicle and software from each other. The advantage: More than ever before, all future BMW models will remain digitally up to date via over-the-air upgrades and will receive updates even from the next and subsequent vehicle generations," says Frank Weber, Board Member for Development at BMW AG.

A fundamental component of the digital nervous system is the radically simplified wiring harness. It is based on a so-called zonal wiring harness architecture, which uses 600 meters less wiring and brings 30% weight savings compared to the previous generation. The wiring harness is divided into four zones: front end, center, rear and roof. The Superbrains are connected via high-speed data connections to smaller control units, the zonal controllers, which manage and consolidate the data flow of the electronics in and out of the zones. The wiring in the vehicle is therefore zone-related and can thus be shorter, thinner, and lighter.

A crucial prerequisite for thinner and lighter wiring are the so-called "Smart eFuses". These are digital fuses that replace up to 150 traditional fuses. Smart eFuses can be intelligently programmed for digitally controlled energy distribution to components. The selective activation of components allows for the design of intelligent power modes for various vehicle states such as driving, parking, charging, and upgrading, in which unnecessary consumers can be identified and switched off. Thus, the eFuses make a significant contribution to the 20% improved energy efficiency.

The completely newly developed electronic architecture forms the basis for the next generation SDV. From the launch of the Neue Klasse, the upcoming BMW model generation will benefit from it. The first fully electric derivative of the Neue Klasse will go into series production later this year at the Debrecen plant in Hungary.

The advanced software architecture of BMW builds on this new electronic architecture. With the multitude of digital functions in SDVs, it is crucial that functions can be continuously developed on stable software platforms rather than being newly developed for every new generation. This is precisely what is achieved with the Neue Klasse. In the vehicle the software platforms run on the respective Superbrains, and the vehicle functions run on top of them. The "Shared Service Layer" acts as a connecting element (middleware) and provides, among other things, state-of-the-art cybersecurity and flexible over-the-air updates. It also enables customer-relevant AI functions thanks to intelligent networking of cross-domain data sources.

"With the introduction of the Neue Klasse, we are entering a mode of software development where we achieve software continuity. This means we continuously develop software rather than starting from scratch each time," says Christoph Grote, Senior Vice President BMW Group Electronics and Software. "Based on our advanced software architecture and the fact that today our global development teams generate 130 times more software than ten years ago, we see ourselves in an excellent competitive position. More than ever, our software developers can focus on product innovations."

For the Neue Klasse, the development teams are working on well over 1,000 software modules, over 20 GB of software, and over 500 million lines of code, which will ultimately be integrated into the Superbrains and the rest of the electronic architecture in the vehicle. To achieve this, BMW has established a solid foundation for future-proof and highly effective vehicle software development in recent years. Innovative methods and tools have been anchored in the continuously growing global developer network. At the heart of vehicle software development is the integrated developer environment: a tailored tool-chain called "CodeCraft." The speed and quality of development have been enhanced with the use of a variety of tools that support the software developer with generative AI. CodeCraft runs in the cloud on up to 75,000 virtual CPUs, supports the simultaneous work of well over 10,000 software developers, and records up to 200,000 software builds per day at peak times. This corresponds to a productivity increase of more than 130 times compared to ten years ago.

Concentration of computing power for essential customer functions in four “Superbrains”

The first Superbrain carries the joy of electric driving into the future and is therefore named “Heart of Joy”. In fully electric BMWs of the Neue Klasse, the first completely BMW-developed driving dynamics control system will be used: BMW Dynamic Performance Control. It enables the most precise driving experience to date, efficient energy recuperation, impressive smoothness even at low speeds, and perfect traction for dynamic acceleration. Motor and chassis control are combined in a single control unit for the first time and respond with a delay of less than one millisecond, ten times faster than the previously used control units.

The second Superbrain for automated driving controls the latest generation of automated and highly automated driving functions. It integrates what was previously distributed across four control units into one powerful computing unit and has twenty times the computing power compared to the previous generation.

The third Superbrain controls BMW Panoramic iDrive and thus the digital experience in the vehicle with the infotainment operating system BMW Operating System X. It orchestrates all content in the BMW Panoramic Vision, 3D Head-Up Display, and central display, as well as voice interaction, entertainment, and navigation. This Superbrain ensures the intuitive customer experience of BMW Panoramic iDrive and expands it with intelligent, AI-supported, and cloud-based functions.

The fourth Superbrain is responsible for basic functions and acts as the control center for managing vehicle states. It controls fundamental functions such as vehicle access, climate and comfort, interior and exterior lighting, data flow and processing, as well as remote software upgrades. Up to 100 vehicle functions are integrated into this single unit, and it is connected to up to 50 sensors.

Intelligent preprocessing of data by the Superbrains in the vehicle enables optimized data exchange with the BMW Cloud.

Long-standing and proven strategy for software development.

BMW is managing the digital transformation with a consistent and long-term strategy. With the founding of BMW CarIT over 20 years ago, software development began in-house. Since then, the company has expanded its development teams in a global network. In total, BMW employs around 10,000 IT and software experts worldwide.

Despite a high level of internal expertise, BMW has always believed that developing the complete vehicle software in-house would never be sensible. Therefore, the company consistently pusues a strategic “Make-or-Buy” approach. This means, on the one hand, that brand-defining and differentiating software is developed in-house. This includes, for example, the infotainment operating system, which has now been developed by BMW in its tenth generation. Crucial software layers for executing over-the-air updates or the control software for the driving experience are also developed internally. Basic functionalities, on the other hand, for which leading solutions already exist and which do not significantly shape customer experience are sourced from leading companies in the industry or covered through open-source solutions.

BMW Group in the United States.

BMW of North America, LLC was established 50 years ago to support the sales, marketing and distribution of BMW automobiles and motorcycles in the U.S. In 1993 BMW Group Financial Services NA, LLC was founded, and one year later BMW Manufacturing Co., LLC began assembling vehicles in South Carolina.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Irlbach-Strasskirchen . Las instalaciones de producción se están trasladando a la nueva planta de ensamblaje de BMW Group para baterías de alta tensión (voltaje), que está casi terminada. Un hito importante poco más de un año después de que comenzara la construcción en abril de 2024. BMW Group confía en la experiencia de Alemania: todas las empresas constructoras y más de tres cuartas partes de los especialistas en construcción de plantas provienen de Alemania y, en particular, de Bavaria.

Durante una visita, el Primer Ministro de Bavaria, Dr. Markus Söder, junto con los miembros de la mesa directiva de BMW AG [EXECUTIVE_OFFICER] y Milan Nedeljković, pudo ver por sí mismo el progreso del proyecto de innovación en el distrito de Straubing-Bogen. Markus Söder: "¡Bavaria es territorio automovilístico! BMW está construyendo una gran fábrica para baterías de alta tecnología en Irlbach y Straßkirchen en Baja Bavaria. Aquí es donde se está creando la electromovilidad del futuro. Toda la región rural se beneficiará de esto. La alta tecnología y el futuro encajan perfectamente con Bavaria: el automóvil es nuestra industria más importante, y BMW es un embajador de marca global para nuestro Estado Libre. Cuando BMW prospera, Bavaria prospera. Creemos en el automóvil y en nuestras empresas."

En el futuro, las baterías de alta tensión para la Neue Klasse se fabricarán en la Planta Irlbach-Strasskirchen de BMW Group. Dr. Milan Nedeljković, miembro de la Junta Directiva de BMW AG, Producción, explicó: “La Neue Klasse está llena de innovaciones, y esto también se refleja en las tecnologías de fabricación. En el futuro, las plantas de vehículos alemanas recibirán baterías de alta tensión de sexta generación desde esta ubicación.” BMW Group ha tomado la decisión consciente de invertir en Bavaria. Nedeljković continúa: “Este trabajo demuestra que la alta tecnología tiene un futuro en Alemania.” Un requisito previo para el progreso tecnológico es la estrecha cooperación entre la investigación, la industria y la política.

[EXECUTIVE_OFFICER], miembro de la Junta Directiva de BMW AG responsable para Personal y Bienes Raíces, Directora de Relaciones Laborales: “Nuestra nueva Planta Irlbach-Strasskirchen es un ejemplo de cómo son posibles asentamientos industriales exitosos en Alemania. Un punto de prueba es nuestra exitosa colaboración con nuestros socios. Esto fue posible en estrecha cooperación con el gobierno estatal de Bavaria, políticos locales comprometidos, así como las autoridades y la población locales. Y esto a “Velocidad Bavara” — más rápido que cualquier otro proyecto de construcción en Alemania en los últimos años. Con esta nueva planta, estamos asegurando miles de empleos en Bavaria en tiempos de creciente movilidad eléctrica y estamos dando forma al futuro de la movilidad individual.”

Tecnología Alemana de vanguardia

En los próximos meses, los empleados de BMW Group ensamblarán y establecerán las instalaciones de producción junto con empresas asociadas. Más de tres cuartas partes de los instaladores de sistemas de producción provienen de Alemania, y cada tercera empresa de más de 30 socios proviene de Bavaria. De este modo, BMW Group confía en la tecnología de vanguardia alemana al seleccionar a sus instaladores y también sigue el enfoque local para la tecnología de producción.

Se espera que las primeras baterías de alta tensión se produzcan para fines de este año con fines de prueba. La producción en serie en la nueva ubicación está programada para comenzar a finales de 2026.

Experiencia local en construcción y puesta en marcha

La construcción de la planta de ensamble de baterías de alta tensión avanza según lo planeado. BMW Group confía en la experiencia local: todas las empresas constructoras contratadas directamente provienen de Alemania, dos tercios de Bavaria y cada tercera empresa contratada proviene de un radio de 100 kilómetros de la nueva planta. Al mismo tiempo, BMW Group está proporcionando un importante impulso a la economía alemana.

A finales de junio de 2024, se instaló el primero de 1,066 pilares en el edificio de producción central. Doce meses después, el equipamiento técnico del edificio ha avanzado tanto que ahora se está comenzando la instalación de los sistemas de producción.

Campaña de calificación asegura empleos en la transformación

Se crearán 1,600 empleos en la nueva planta. A través de procesos internos de selección y aplicación, BMW Group está reclutando actualmente a interesados para operar la Planta Irlbach-Strasskirchen. Muchos futuros empleados tienen experiencia en la fabricación de baterías. En el centro de competencia para la electromovilidad en Dingolfing, a solo 40 kilómetros de distancia, ahora producen la quinta generación de baterías de alta tensión. Pero también hay empleados de otras áreas de producción que están aplicando internamente para la nueva ubicación.

Se han lanzado numerosos programas para reentrenar y calificar a los empleados. Los equipos se caracterizan por su disposición a aprender y a cambiar. Además, en septiembre de 2025, por segundo año consecutivo, 50 jóvenes comenzarán su aprendizaje en Dingolfing y Regensburg, para trabajar en Irlbach-Strasskirchen en el futuro.

Los exigentes y prometedores empleos en la nueva ubicación — para muchos, cercana — añaden valor a la región rural y proporcionan un poderoso impulso económico.

# BMW NA 50th Anniversary | 50 Stories for 50 Years [ADDRESS]: “The BMW X7: The U.S. Market Always Wants More.”
## In the 1990s, when so-called Soccer Moms began abandoning minivans in favor of SUVs, they found themselves missing the third row of seating that made minivans so ideal as family or team transportation. That was true whether the SUV in question was a Ford Explorer, Jeep Cherokee, or, after 1999, a BMW X5 Sports Activity Vehicle (E53).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the 1990s, when so-called Soccer Moms began abandoning minivans in favor of SUVs, they found themselves missing the third row of seating that made minivans so ideal as family or team transportation. That was true whether the SUV in question was a Ford Explorer, Jeep Cherokee, or, after 1999, a BMW X5 Sports Activity Vehicle (E53).

When BMW’s product planners, designers, and engineers began working on the second-generation (E70) X5, they knew it would need more seating to remain competitive. “When we did the E70, we struggled to get a third row of seating in it,” said Rich Brekus, then Head of Product Planning and Strategy for BMW of North America. “Albert Biermann [project leader] did a phenomenal job, but it became obvious that a third row in the E70 wasn’t going to work very well.”

Introduced in 2006, the E70 featured dimensions that had remained more or less unchanged from those of the first-generation E53 X5—the wheelbase had increased by just 4.5 inches, the overall length by 7.4 inches. BMW had added a third row of seating, but the space was too cramped for all but the smallest adults; even children had to fold themselves up to sit there, and the space received little light or ventilation.

“It was clear there was a market for a bigger X5, and we started asking for an X5L, like a $3,000 upgrade,” Brekus said. “Munich suggested an X7, but I said these families needed a third row of seating, not an X7.”

Munich preferred a larger, more upscale vehicle, and so did BMW’s U.S. dealers. “The dealers are always asking for a vehicle above the X5,” said Ludwig Willisch shortly after he arrived in Woodcliff Lake as BMW NA CEO in October 2011. “Not a single day goes by that I don’t get a phone call asking when the new X7 will be available.”

Indeed, the lack of proper three-row SAV meant that BMW was losing customers not only to its traditional German rivals but to domestic automakers whose large SUVs were designed expressly for active families and could seat six or seven passengers comfortably. “A consumer who preferred European cars would never consider an American car if he or she wanted a BMW, a Porsche, or a Mercedes, but that isn’t true when it comes to SUVs,” Willisch said. “And if you weren’t ready to deliver, you’d lose out.”

In December 2011, Willisch made his case for an X7 to the BMW board. “I stated how well others were selling in that bracket, and we weren't, because we didn't have a product. And so the chairman [Dr. Norbert Reithofer] said, ‘Ludwig, you have a point, and I will fight with you for that product. It's going to happen.’”

The X7 took a major step closer to reality in late 2014, when BMW announced a $1 billion expansion of its Spartanburg plant. At the time, Spartanburg was BMW’s only factory assembling large SAVs, and it was running flat-out to meet global demand for X5s and X3s. The expansion would allow BMW’s “center of competence” for Sports Activity Vehicles to assemble a new model identified as the X7, for which BMW NA announced a rather optimistic on-sale date of February 2017.

The X7 project had been initiated thanks to U.S. demand, and BMW NA would play a key role in its development. In 2009, Brekus had been replaced as Head of Product Planning by Paul Ferraiolo; in December 2014, Ferraiolo tapped Kate Alini to manage U.S.-market development of a new series of luxury models: the increasingly upscale 7 Series sedan as well as the new 8 Series and X7. Where the X7 was concerned, Alini was a perfect fit for the vehicle’s intended demographic.

“I was driving an E70 X5, and I had three young kids that I had to drop off at school every day,” Alini said. “In the US, you have to get in and out of the drop-off zone really quickly, and I was holding up the line because it took so long to wrestle my kids out of their car seats, especially the one all the way in the back. They made me pull over into the bus zone.”

Since the school drop-off—not to mention large SUVs— is virtually unknown in Europe, Alini sent videos of the scene to her colleagues in Munich, to convince them of the need not only for more spacious third-row seating but for easier ingress and egress throughout the vehicle. In that, the domestic SUVs had an inherent advantage, since they shared their chassis with full-size pickup trucks. The E70 X5’s unit-construction chassis was much smaller, and so was the F15 X5 introduced in 2013.

BMW had tried to build an X7 atop the X5 chassis, but it simply didn’t work. “They tried to work with the existing [F15] X5, but the wheelhouses were too small,” Willisch said. “With the size of the car, the small wheels looked awful. Aesthetically, it had to wait for the next platform.”

That platform was the unit-construction Cluster Architecture (CLAR) platform that debuted with BMW’s G11 7 Series sedan in 2015, and which would provide the foundation for subsequent large BMWs, including the fourth-generation G05 X5 that debuted in 2018. CLAR gave BMW more flexibility where size and configuration were concerned, and it would allow the company to finally build an X7 with fully-accessible third-row seating. It would be BMW’s largest SAV to date, but it would still be fairly compact compared to full-size SUVs from other manufacturers.

“The X7 is quite a bit narrower than a Mercedes G-class, for example, not to mention the Lincoln Navigator or Cadillac Escalade,” said Rich Steinberg, who succeeded Ferraiolo as Head of Product Planning in 2015. “Those cars offered a fair amount of room to get to the third row, so we had a lot of discussion about how to maximize the interior layout to allow access to the third row of seats.”

Even as it approached those vehicles in size, it needed to retain BMW’s signature performance, particularly where handling was concerned. “It had to be a BMW,” Steinberg said. “We were losing customers who like driving BMWs but needed more space, and who were switching to other marques to get it. It was important that the X7 keep the BMW DNA intact, that it have the sporting driving experience that’s typical of any BMW.”

As its nomenclature indicated, the X7 would be positioned upscale compared to the rough-and-ready X5. “We were switching the 6 Series Coupe to the 8 Series, and the idea was to command a higher premium [price] based on higher levels of premium features,” Steinberg said.

“In terms of the overall concept, the X7 wasn’t just a bigger X5. It’s a luxury vehicle, and it’s got to have presence,” Alini said. “The kidney grille on the X7 concept vehicle was enormous, and when I first saw the car in Munich I was like, ‘Whoa! That’s a lot of chrome!’ They decreased the size of the grille slightly for production, but the verticality of the kidney combined with the horizontal headlights was very modern, very contemporary. It gave the X7 real presence.”

The X7’s kidney grille was the largest ever designed for a BMW, and it was flanked by slim headlights that emphasized the car’s width in relation to its height. BMW’s press release highlighted its “harmonious proportions,” as well as “a new use of forms dominated by clearly structured surfaces and precise lines [that] lend the X7 its modern aura.” Those surfaces and lines had a slimming effect, making the X7 appear both neater and lighter than its X5 stablemate, even though it was slightly larger; so did BMW’s first-ever 22-inch wheels, which rectified the aesthetic problems that Willisch had identified years earlier.

Following a long gestation period, the X7 was revealed to the public as the “Concept X7 iPerformance” at the Frankfurt auto show in September 2017.

Along with the CLAR platform, the X7 concept shared much of the 7 Series’ design language, including the sedan’s large, vertically-oriented kidney grille.

In accordance with its original mission, the X7 could accommodate seven full-sized adults, or six if the customer chose to replace the standard second-row bench seating with a pair of optional captain’s chairs. That idea came from Alini, who’d seen them on her friends’ domestic SUVs.

“They were the coolest things, because the kids could just jump right through to the third row,” Alini said. “I had to convince Munich to make them optional, which I did by showing them how kids got to the third row in an X5: They climb over the seats, and their sneakers scratch up the headliner.”

Since the U.S. would represent more than half the worldwide market for X7s, Alini’s opinions carried plenty of weight at the FIZ, the engineering and design center in Munich where the car was being developed. So did those of her Chinese counterpart, who also represented a substantial market for this luxury SAV.

“I wanted captain’s chairs with a pass-through, and they wanted captain’s chairs with huge bolsters and a giant console in the middle, because they’re always being chauffeured,” she said. “They didn’t care about the third row, but we needed it, and we needed the ability to get back there. The car’s only so wide, so how do we make it so that a human can get through? I remember being in the seating buck, and our counterparts from other countries just didn’t get it.”

Alini got the captain’s chairs—“It was a compromise, but it works!”—and she also ensured that the X7 was well equipped with another feature essential to American customers: cupholders. “We need a cupholder for every passenger in the U.S.,” she said. “But when you have the captain’s chairs, you lose two cupholders. You can put a bottle in the door pocket, but you can’t put a coffee or a fountain soda in there. Munich wanted to put the cupholders on the floor between the captain’s chairs, but that was a tripping hazard on the way to the third row. I was fighting for everything I could to make life as easy as possible.”

Alini’s advocacy was backed up by CEO Willisch, who accompanied her to Munich to check on the X7’s progress. “He was super-supportive,” she said. “He really got it, and the fact that he would go to the FIZ and check out a seating buck, knowing that I’m fighting for cupholders and pass-throughs… I don’t know if CEOs normally get involved with those kinds of things, but Willisch was super-involved.”

The X7 would never be as wide as its American counterparts, but access to the second- and third-row seating was improved by making the X7’s rear doors longer than those up front. In addition, all of the X7’s seats were electrically adjustable fore and aft as well as for seat-back angle, and they could even be adjusted from the driver’s seat or from the cargo area via redundant controls. In addition to ensuring the X7’s passengers easy access and comfortable seating, Alini also had to make sure the X7 could accommodate their stuff, whether that was sports equipment, groceries, or luggage for a long trip. “Munich wanted to get rid of the split tailgate we had on the X5, but I said we cannot lose that,” she said. “It wasn’t just a market differentiator (at the time, only Range Rover offered a split tailgate). It was also highly functional. If we’re going to have a smaller trunk than our competitors we better make it more accessible and easy to use.” The X7 got its split tailgate, an electric one that could be opened or closed at the touch of a button.

Along with new exterior design language, the X7 was part of an interior design revolution that brought more light into the interior. According to the press release, the X7’s “large windows and a long, flowing roofline” created “a spacious interior bathed in light.” A panoramic sunroof was standard, along with electrically controlled headliner shades that could be deployed from any seating position. That included the third row, where an additional overhead glass panel let in natural light, and where a new five-zone climate control system could moderate temperatures. “That was another thing that other markets didn’t care about,” Alini said, “but a lot of Americans put pets in the back of the car as well as people, and they need AC back there. So, the third row has natural light, its own AC, and its own cupholders, and that changes the whole experience. You’re not sitting in the trunk anymore, but in the third row of a beautiful and comfortable vehicle.”

Beyond new functionality, the X7 interior brought an unprecedented degree of luxury to BMW’s SAV lineup, with elegant touches like ambient lighting, aromatherapy, and cut crystal for some of the control knobs and the gear shift. “I remember thinking it seemed a bit over the top at the time, but then I saw it, and it really did elevate the interior,” Alini said. “We still aimed to be the sportiest, most dynamic vehicle in the segment, and adding those elements didn’t compromise drivability in any way. It was still a BMW—just a more elevated expression of it.

In 2018, prospective customers finally had the opportunity to preview the X7 in some 125 “closed room” events around the U.S.. “We created a lot of excitement around the vehicle, and when pre-orders started we got several hundred in the first 24 hours,” Alini said.

The X7 was the first vehicle that customers could pre-order online through the BMW USA website before taking delivery at their local dealer. Once their vehicles arrived, customers were treated to a suitably luxurious level of service, one that surpassed the premium experience for which BMW was already known. “We were just getting into the luxury space—we were launching ten new models in the luxury segment, all larger cars at a higher price point—and we wanted to elevate the whole experience so that it reflected the nuances of luxury, not premium,” Alini said. “We developed a program that allowed dealers to offer conveniences like vehicle pick-up and drop-off, expedited service appointment scheduling, and other time-saving benefits.

X7 assembly began at Spartanburg in December 2018, and all of those customer-service details had been worked out by the time BMW’s new luxury SAV went on sale in the US in March 2019. Two models were offered initially: the six-cylinder X7 xDrive40i and the V8-powered X7 xDrive50i, priced at $73,900 and $92,600, respectively. An eight-speed Steptronic automatic transmission was standard in both models, as was Dynamic Damper Control air suspension. The X7 would be offered only with all-wheel drive, another element of the X7’s premium positioning, and limiting the drivetrain options reduced the cost of bringing the X7 to market. Finally, the X7 was available with BMW’s top-shelf driver aids and connectivity/infotainment features, and a full slate of comfort and convenience options.

As a luxury SAV whose final retail price can easily exceed six figures, the X7 would never be a high-volume vehicle like the smaller and more affordable X5 or X3. Even so, it’s been a strong performer throughout its lifecycle.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Múnich/Miramas. El desarrollo del primer modelo de producción en serie de la Neue Klasse está en la recta final: los prototipos de la próxima generación del BMW iX3 están actualmente en pruebas extensivas en el área de pruebas de BMW Group en Miramas, en el sur de Francia. El Vehículo de Actividades Deportivas (SAV) celebrará su estreno mundial en el IAA Mobility 2025 en Múnich en septiembre y saldrá de la línea de producción en la nueva planta de BMW Group en Debrecen (Hungría) a partir de finales de año.

“Mayor autonomía, carga más rápida, un concepto de visualización y operación completamente nuevo, y la inteligencia de cuatro supercerebros son las características distintivas de la Neue Klasse. Con el próximo BMW iX3 – el primer modelo de la nueva generación de automóviles – estamos introduciendo actualizaciones tecnológicas fundamentales con el claro objetivo de elevar el placer de conducir típico de BMW a un nivel completamente nuevo”, dice Mike Reichelt, Jefe de la Neue Klasse BMW. “Con el completamente nuevo BMW iX3, llevamos nuestras tecnologías revolucionarias a la producción en serie por primera vez, y estamos ansiosos por verlo en acción en la carretera. Todos los futuros modelos de BMW, independientemente del tipo de tren motriz, se beneficiarán de las innovaciones y conjuntos tecnológicos de la Neue Klasse."

Las nuevas tecnologías en un vistazo:

BMW Panoramic iDrive: “Manos en el volante, ojos en la carretera”.

El BMW Panoramic iDrive muestra toda la información relevante de conducción en la línea de visión ideal del conductor y maximiza la eficiencia ergonómica y la seguridad. Cuatro elementos se combinan para crear una experiencia de usuario única:

El BMW Panoramic iDrive funciona bajo el BMW Operating System X, también un nuevo desarrollo. Ofrece una amplia personalización, soporte inteligente para el conductor y actualizaciones de software extensas. El lema de BMW “Manos en el volante, ojos en la carretera” se redefine con una mezcla equilibrada de controles físicos y funciones digitales. El BMW Panoramic iDrive garantizará una operación amigable e intuitiva en cada segmento de vehículo y con cada concepto de tren motriz.

Próxima generación de trenes motrices eléctricos.

El concepto de batería de alta tensión para la sexta generación de tecnología eDrive de BMW (Gen6) es fundamentalmente nuevo y, junto con el portafolio revisado de sistemas de propulsión eléctrica, ofrece una solución óptima para todos los segmentos de vehículos. El sistema Gen6 hará su debut en el BMW iX3 y luego se implementará en todos los segmentos de vehículos. El componente central de la batería de alta tensión – la celda de batería cilíndrica de BMW – tiene una densidad energética un 20 por ciento mayor que las celdas prismáticas utilizadas anteriormente. Las celdas están integradas directamente en la batería de alta tensión, lo que juega un papel importante en la estructura del cuerpo de los modelos de la Neue Klasse.

Carga más rápido, conduce más lejos. El Gen6 introduce un gran avance para nuestros clientes y el BMW iX3 es el primero en beneficiarse. [ADDRESS] kW de carga máxima, nuestros clientes pueden añadir más de 350 km* (WLTP) a la autonomía de su vehículo en solo 10 minutos. La tecnología Gen6 permite a los usuarios monitorear el rendimiento de carga y la curva en tiempo real a través de la My BMW App. La tecnología de 800V está allanando el camino para la carga rápida. Cargar en estaciones de carga de 400V DC también seguirá siendo posible, por supuesto. El alto contenido energético de la batería de alta tensión, junto con el diseño eficiente del tren motriz y del vehículo en general, permite una autonomía de hasta 800 km (WLTP).

Otras innovaciones relacionadas con la carga. Hacer que el proceso de carga sea aún más amigable para el usuario es la tapa de carga inteligente, que detecta cuando el conductor tiene la intención de detenerse a cargar el automóvil y se abre (y luego se cierra) automáticamente. Uno de los desencadenantes para abrir la tapa es asistido por IA: si el cliente se acerca a un punto de carga familiar o aprendido, el progreso hacia él revela una intención de cargar y la tapa se abre.

El inicio de producción del nuevo BMW iX3 también introducirá amplias funciones de carga bidireccional – Vehicle-to-Load, Vehicle-to-Home y Vehicle-to-Grid: Vehicle-to-Load (V2L) convierte el vehículo en un potente banco de energía móvil (hasta 3.7 kW en Europa) y suministra energía para uno o varios consumidores, donde sea que los clientes la necesiten.

La capacidad de carga bidireccional convierte al BMW iX3 en una unidad de almacenamiento de energía en el hogar. Vehicle-to-Home (V2H) ayuda a los clientes a reducir costos. Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) establece nuevos estándares para la integración del vehículo en el mercado energético. Ambas funciones contribuyen a reducir las emisiones y aumentar el uso de fuentes de energía regenerativas. De esta manera, BMW Group demuestra que es parte de la solución mientras trabajamos hacia la transformación energética.

Proporcionando la clave para la carga bidireccional junto con la tecnología involucrada, el nuevo BMW Wallbox (DC) ofrece carga y descarga de 19.2 kW dependiendo del mercado. El equipo de carga de BMW ha sido rediseñado y ahora es más fácil de usar, e incluye adaptadores seleccionados, por ejemplo, para casos de uso de Vehicle-to-Load (V2L).

La experiencia de conducción de BMW con el Heart of Joy.

La nueva referencia en el placer de conducción puro. El "supercerebro" Heart of Joy en la Neue Klasse eleva la dinámica de conducción a un nuevo nivel. Junto con el software BMW Dynamic Performance Control, el Heart of Joy es fundamental para el tren motriz, los frenos, la recuperación y las subfunciones del sistema de dirección. Procesa información diez veces más rápido* que los sistemas anteriores y, por lo tanto, responde más directamente que nunca a los deseos del conductor.

Se requieren menos intervenciones, la estabilidad direccional es más precisa y estable. Como resultado, el vehículo desarrolla características de giro consistentes y reproducibles y puede ser dirigido de manera intuitiva.

Las funciones del tren motriz y de frenado también trabajan juntas de manera armoniosa para desacelerar el vehículo. La recuperación o frenado regenerativo se puede utilizar en todo el rango de velocidad hasta detenerse. De hecho, en el 98 por ciento de los casos, el vehículo puede detenerse sin aplicar los frenos de fricción – sin ruido ni sacudidas.

El Heart of Joy y el BMW Dynamic Performance Control elevan la experiencia de conducción de

BMW a un nuevo nivel – desde el arranque hasta los límites dinámicos.

Desarrollo adicional de sistemas de asistencia al conductor utilizando la computadora de alto rendimiento inteligente “Supercerebro de la Conducción Automatizada” Los últimos sistemas de asistencia al conductor de BMW Group están entre los mejores del mundo. El nuevo BMW iX3 marca el inicio del despliegue de la próxima generación de tecnología. Esto está en línea con la filosofía ADAS (Sistema Avanzado de Asistencia al Conductor) de BMW: “Siempre inteligente, simbiótico y seguro”.

BMW Group fusiona el sistema de asistencia basado en reglas probado con un nuevo sistema basado en IA. En una simbiosis óptima, esta combinación apoya al conductor de manera aún más precisa y confiable en situaciones desafiantes en la carretera. El Supercerebro de la Conducción Automatizada agrupa todas las funciones del cliente para la conducción automatizada y tiene una velocidad de procesamiento 20 veces más rápida que el sistema anterior. Las nuevas funciones de conducción y estacionamiento automatizadas se basan en tecnología de sensores, software, procesadores y comunicaciones móviles de vanguardia.

El modelo básico del BMW iX3 ofrece funciones como advertencia de cambio de carril, advertencia de prioridad de carretera, salida segura y vista asistida. La salida segura utiliza radares montados en los laterales para monitorear el tráfico junto al automóvil mientras se detiene y advierte al conductor sobre objetos que se acercan. La nueva Vista Asistida muestra la situación de conducción más reciente de manera precisa y detallada, alternativamente en la Pantalla Central, la Visión Panorámica o el Head-Up Display 3D.

El asistente de autopista con cambio de carril automático estará disponible con funciones ampliadas en el BMW iX3. A petición, puede ayudar a los conductores desde que se incorporan a una autopista hasta que la abandonan y permitir que los conductores quiten las manos del volante durante largos períodos. Este asistente permanece activo incluso durante cambios automatizados en la autopista a lo largo de una ruta de navegación activa. El nuevo Asistente de Autopista y Ciudad ayuda al conductor en situaciones de conducción complejas en áreas urbanas, por ejemplo, a través de esquinas estrechas o rotondas. Frena automáticamente en semáforos en rojo y vuelve a avanzar o emite una señal audible cuando las luces se ponen en verde.

La asistencia al conductor simbiótica, como se conoce, permite una interacción perfecta entre la tecnología y el conductor en cuanto a funciones de confort y seguridad, y crea una transición fluida entre la dirección cooperativa y – un primicia mundial – el frenado cooperativo.

Cuando la función está activa, el conductor puede influir en el sistema en cualquier momento sin que el asistente se apague al girar el volante o aplicar los frenos ligeramente para ajustar las respuestas del sistema.

Las funciones de estacionamiento se pueden activar de manera intuitiva y ofrecen una selección basada en IA de servicios de asistencia para estacionamiento, reconocimiento de espacios de estacionamiento, planificación de maniobras y una experiencia de estacionamiento mejorada. Las funciones de monitoreo ampliadas ayudan al conductor a evitar daños al vehículo mientras estaciona.

Las innovaciones de la Neue Klasse son basadas en IA, inteligentes y compatibles con actualizaciones. Gracias a la nueva arquitectura electrónica y de software con cuatro supercerebros (computadoras de alto rendimiento), el nuevo BMW iX3 es ahora notablemente más inteligente en situaciones cotidianas – por ejemplo, con los sistemas avanzados de asistencia al conductor y el mejorado asistente de voz BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant. Debido a la potente BMW Cloud, la nueva arquitectura electrónica y de software de la nueva generación de vehículos está lista para numerosas funciones inteligentes, de las cuales los clientes podrán beneficiarse a través de actualizaciones por aire después del lanzamiento al mercado.

Un gran número de las solicitudes de patentes presentadas por BMW en los últimos años han surgido como parte del desarrollo de tecnologías para la Neue Klasse – por ejemplo, en la tecnología de proyección para el BMW Panoramic Vision, en las funciones de control innovadoras del Heart of Joy, en la gestión de baterías y el sistema de contacto de celdas de la batería de alta tensión, en el nuevo motor eléctrico y en el nuevo sistema eléctrico zonal del vehículo.

*Dado que se trata de un prototipo en fase de desarrollo, las cifras proporcionadas son provisionales. La información sobre el consumo de energía según WLTP aún no está disponible.

# De los prototipos a la producción en serie: el nuevo BMW iX5 Hydrogen
## • Enfoque de Apertura de Tecnologías como factor estratégico de éxito • Por primera vez en BMW: cinco variantes de tren motriz en un solo vehículo • Iniciativa HyMoS para promover el desarrollo de ecosistemas locales de hidrógeno
Date: 2025-09-22 | Author: Lisa Aigner BMW Group | ID: T0452907ES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Múnich. El Grupo BMW está lanzando un vehículo con cinco tecnologías de tren motriz diferentes. El nuevo BMW X5 será el primer modelo en ofrecer a los clientes la posibilidad de elegir entre tecnología eléctrica de batería, híbrido conectable, gasolina, diesel y pila de combustible de hidrógeno. La iniciativa HyMoS (Hydrogen Mobility at Scale) está diseñada para promover el desarrollo de ecosistemas de hidrógeno y estaciones de recarga en áreas metropolitanas y apunta a una implementación piloto inicial en Alemania. Nota: La disponibilidad de las variantes de tren motriz dependerá de cada mercado.

“Al lanzar el nuevo BMW X5 con cinco variantes de sistema de propulsión, una vez más estamos demostrando nuestra posición de liderazgo como pioneros tecnológicos”, afirma Joachim Post, miembro del Consejo de Administración de BMW AG, Desarrollo, en un evento de BMW en Nueva York. “El hidrógeno tiene un papel esencial que desempeñar en la descarbonización global, por lo que estamos comprometidos a seguir impulsando esta tecnología en el futuro.

Enfoque tecnológico abierto: factor estratégico de éxito

La Apertura de Tecnologías sigue siendo un factor clave de éxito para el Grupo BMW. Una amplia gama de sistemas de propulsión —que abarca motores de combustión, híbridos conectables, modelos totalmente eléctricos con batería y, a partir del nuevo BMW iX5 Hydrogen en 2028, tecnología de celdas de combustible de hidrógeno— sienta las bases para satisfacer con éxito las variadas demandas y necesidades de los clientes en todo el mundo, tanto ahora como en el futuro.

Estructuras de fabricación flexibles y altos niveles de experiencia en integración permiten que este conjunto de tecnologías de tren motriz se implemente de manera eficiente en la gama del nuevo BMW X5 en términos de desarrollo, compras y producción. Esto significa que la gama de modelos de BMW incluirá dos tipos de tren motriz completamente eléctricos (eléctrico de batería y celda de combustible de hidrógeno-que usa la electricidad generada por las celdas de combustible para alimentar los motores eléctricos) a partir de 2028, subrayando la aplicación rigurosa del enfoque de Apertura de Tecnologías de la marca.

El nuevo BMW iX5 Hydrogen

Tras las exitosas pruebas de la flota piloto en todo el mundo, el nuevo BMW iX5 Hydrogen* ingresará al mercado como el primer modelo de la marca fabricado en serie impulsado por hidrógeno. “El nuevo BMW iX5 Hydrogen será un verdadero BMW, pionero en su clase y con el placer de conducción característico de BMW”, comenta Michael Rath, vicepresidente de Vehículos de Hidrógeno en BMW Group.

La tecnología de propulsión se basa en el sistema de celdas de combustible de tercera generación que BMW Group está desarrollando en colaboración con Toyota Motor Corporation. Este avance tecnológico allana el camino para un sistema con diseño más compacto que, al mismo tiempo, es más potente y eficiente, aumentando así la autonomía y el rendimiento mientras se reduce el consumo de energía. Los centros de competencia de la empresa en Múnich y la planta de BMW Group en Steyr ya están construyendo los primeros prototipos. Otros componentes del sistema de propulsión provendrán de la planta de BMW Group en Landshut.

Ventajas de la tecnología impulsada por hidrógeno

El hidrógeno es reconocido como un posible portador de energía futuro para la descarbonización global. Actúa como un medio de almacenamiento eficiente para fuentes de energía renovable, ayudando a equilibrar la oferta y la demanda y permitiendo una integración más estable y confiable de las energías renovables en la red energética. El hidrógeno es la pieza que falta para completar el rompecabezas de la movilidad eléctrica donde los sistemas de propulsión eléctricos con batería no son una solución óptima.

Iniciativa HyMoS: alianza para fortalecer la infraestructura de hidrógeno

Además de desarrollar el nuevo BMW iX5 Hydrogen, BMW también participa activamente en los esfuerzos para ampliar la red de recarga de hidrógeno. La iniciativa HyMoS (Hydrogen Mobility at Scale, o Movilidad a Hidrógeno en gran Escala) se creó para apoyar ecosistemas de hidrógeno para la movilidad en cooperación con la industria y socios institucionales. El objetivo de esta iniciativa es aumentar la viabilidad económica de los ecosistemas de movilidad con hidrógeno al agrupar la demanda de todo tipo de vehículos, incluidos camiones, autobuses y automóviles de pasajeros. Esto ayudará a lograr una distribución y uso óptimos de las estaciones de carga hidrógeno. La iniciativa apoya proyectos existentes de ecosistemas de hidrógeno para alcanzar su máximo potencial compartiendo experiencias entre proyectos y brindando apoyo de campo a sus socios de la industria. Una fase piloto comenzó con el apoyo de ecosistemas existentes en Alemania y Francia para reunir experiencias de implementación en áreas metropolitanas adicionales y una posible expansión futura a otros países.

## +++ Pre-tax earnings (EBT) of € 5.7 billion secure Group EBT margin of 8.5% at six-month mark +++ Automotive free cash flow of € 2.35 billion in YTD June +++ Automotive Segment EBIT margin in line with annual guidance at 6.2% +++ Significant growth in electrified vehicle sales (+18.6%) in first half of 2025 +++ Record half-year for BMW M models, with 106,000 vehicles delivered (+6.5%) +++ Outlook from Annual Conference confirmed +++
Date: 2025-07-31 | Author: Britta Ullrich BMW Group | ID: T0451902EN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Munich. The BMW Group showed strong resilience in the first half of the year – building on a solid foundation of consistent strategy, robust customer demand, sustained cost discipline and high flexibility. With sales volumes stable at over 1.2 million premium vehicles, and with potential for further growth, the company reported Group earnings before tax of more than € 5.7 billion and an EBT margin of 8.5% in the first six months of 2025.

The Automotive Segment EBIT margin came in at 6.2%, placing it in the upper half of the 5.0-7.0% annual target range, published in March. The segment's free cash flow for the first half-year was € 2.345 billion. At the six-month mark, the BMW Group is therefore on track to meet its targets for the year. "Our performance in the first half of 2025 once again underscores the robustness of our business model. Our success today, as well as in the future, is based on three strong pillars: our global footprint, our strength in innovation, and our technology-neutral approach with highly attractive products," said [EXECUTIVE_OFFICER], Chairman of the Board of BMW AG . "In September, we will begin a new era for BMW when the first vehicle of the NEUE KLASSE makes its debut at the IAA Mobility. With the BMW iX3*, we are kicking off an unprecedented product ramp-up: by 2027, we will launch more than 40 new and revised models across all segments and drive types. Each vehicle will embody the innovative technology clusters and the new design language. This way, we connect technological advancement and exciting products with strategic foresight and economic efficiency."

By offering different drive technologies and a comprehensive range of models, the premium manufacturer from Munich is able to meet diverse customer preferences, reporting growth across numerous markets: Outside of China, BMW deliveries rose across all sales regions, with the brand recording slight growth of +4.7% .

Benefiting from full availability of the New MINI Family, the British cult brand reported significant growth of 17.4% in the first half of the year, with a total of 133,838 vehicles sold. MINI deliveries increased in all regions of the world.

In Europe , the BMW Group posted solid sales growth of +8.2% , with 498,670 units sold (Q2 deliveries: 256,487 units; +10.2%). In the Americas region, deliveries increased by +3.4% to 237,972 vehicles (Q2: 123,254 units; +1.7%).

Deliveries in the US market rose by +2.7% year-on-year, with a total of 193,826 vehicles delivered to customers (Q2: 98,856 units; +1.4%).

Electrified models and BMW M vehicles with increased sales volumes

With a 26.4% share (Q2: 26.0%) of total sales in the first six months, more than one in four BMW Group vehicles delivered – precisely 319,031 units – was electrified. Europe recorded the highest growth rates for BEVs and PHEVs, at 34,8%.

Alongside electrified vehicles (+6.5%), the high-performance models of the BMW M brand were the main growth drivers for the BMW brand: With nearly 106,000 vehicles sold (+6.5% compared to HY1 2024), BMW M GmbH reported the highest first-half-year sales in its history. The BMW M3* and BMW M3 Touring*, together with the BMW M5* and BMW M5 Touring* introduced at the start of the year, made a significant contribution to this result.

MINI grows with BEV models

MINI’s sales growth also stemmed mainly from MINI BEVs : the MINI Cooper Electric*, the MINI Aceman Electric* and the MINI Countryman Electric*. With a 34.3% share in the first half-year, more than one in three MINIs delivered to customers worldwide was battery-electric.

In the first half of 2025, the Rolls-Royce brand built on the previous year’s strong sales performance, delivering 2,796 handcrafted luxury motor cars to customers (-0.8%). In the second quarter, it increased its sales by +9.4% year-on-year to 1,415 units.

The growing percentage of electrified vehicles confirms the BMW Group's successful approach of offering its customers a broad range of models, all available with different drive technologies. More than 15 fully-electric vehicles and 12 PHEVs are currently available. In the second quarter of 2025, the BMW Group reached a major milestone in its drive train strategy, with the delivery of its 1.5-millionth BEV since the launch of the first BMW i3 in 2013.

Group EBT margin of 8.5% in first half-year

Group revenues for the first half-year totalled € 67,685 million(2024: € 73,558 million/-8.0%; adjusted for currency translation effects: -7.1%; Q2 : € 33,927 million; Q2 2024: € 36,944 million; -8.2%; adjusted for currency translation effects: -5.5%).

Compared with the previous year, revenues were pressured by currency translation headwinds and the expected subdued demand in China. The positive impact of strong growth in new leasing business at BMW Group Financial Services resulted in higher revenue eliminations between segments, which dampened Group revenues.

Following a peak in R&D spending and capital expenditure in 2024, this trend was reversed, as expected, in the first half of the year – without compromising the premium manufacturer's commitment to innovation leadership.

Driven by a strong operating performance, the BMW Group’s expenditure for research and development totalled € 4,020 million in the first six months of the year (2024: € 4,169 million/-3.6%). This figure was down slightly on the previous year, despite intensive preparations for the upcoming models of the NEUE KLASSE, including the BMW iX3 and other successor models. R&D spending focused on digitalisation of the vehicle fleet and electrification across all model series. As planned, administrative and sales expenses were reduced, and capital expenditure for property, plant and equipment also declined.

Between January and June, the BMW Group reported pre-tax earnings (EBT) of € 5,727 million (2024: € 8,023 million/-28.6%; Q2 : € 2,614 million; Q2 2024: € 3,861 million; -32.3%).

The EBT margin for the first half year was 8.5% (2024: 10.9%; in Q2 : 7.7%; Q2 2024: 10.5%). Group net profit for the first half of the year totalled € 4,015 million (2024: € 5,656 million/-29.0%; Q2 : € 1,842 million/-31.9%).

Automotive Segment EBIT margin within annual target range

In the first half of the year, the Automotive Segment generated revenues of € 58,654 million (2024: € 63,009 million/-6.9%; adjusted for currency translation effects: -5.9%; Q2 : € 29,443 million; -8.2%; adjusted for currency translation effects: -5.3%). This year-on-year decrease was mainly due to currency translation headwinds and due to the expected decline in sales revenues in China.

Segment earnings before financial result (EBIT) for the first half-year amounted to € 3,626 million (2024: € 5,394 million/-32.8%; Q2 : € 1,602 million; -40.3%). The EBIT margin came in at 6.2% (2024: 8.6%; Q2: 5.4%). Excluding depreciation and amortisation from the BBA purchase price allocation , the EBIT margin for the first half-year was 7.3% . The impact of tariff increases – particularly the European Commission’s anti-subsidy measures on Chinese BEVs and the sharp rise in US tariff duties – created headwinds in the automotive segment corresponding to the amount of around 1.5%-points of its EBIT margin in the first half-year.

“Even despite higher tariffs, the BMW Group’s business model remains intact – our popular premium vehicles, global competitive strength and high level of resilience provide us with a strong and sustainable foundation. Our footprint in the US is helping us limit the impact of tariffs,” said Walter Mertl, member of the Board of Management responsible for Finance, during the quarterly conference call in Munich. “Thanks to precise financial control, based on calculated forecasts, we are firmly on track to achieve our targets for the year at the six-month mark. Higher efficiency and optimised cost structures also contribute to achieving our financial goals.”

Free cash flow of € 2,345 million in Automotive Segment in YTD June

After six months, free cash flow in the Automotive Segment totalled € 2,345 million (2024: € 2,289 million) and was thus on track for the annual guidance.

The BMW Group is still targeting a free cash flow of > € 5 billion in the Automotive Segment for the full year.

From January to June, capital expenditure for property, plant and equipment and intangible assets amounted to € 2,736 million (2024: € 3,456 million/-20,8%). The capex ratio came in at 4.0% (Q2: 4.5%; HY1 2024: 4.7%; Q2 2024: 5.8%).

Dynamic performance continues in Financial Services Segment

In the Financial Services Segment , dynamic growth in new leasing business continued in the first six months of the year: The volume of new leasing business rose significantly (+9.5%), with the leasing share of total new business increasing to 40.0% (2024: 35.5%/+4.5% percentage points). The segment concluded a total of 824,672 new financing and leasing contracts worldwide in the first half of the year (2024: 849,908 contracts/-3.0%). This represents a slight year-on-year decrease, owing to the lower number of new contracts concluded in China.

The percentage of new BMW Group vehicles leased or financed by the Financial Services Segment reached 43.7% by the end of the reporting period (2024: 41.2%/+2.5 percentage points). Thanks to a higher financed amount per vehicle, the volume of new business remained stable at € 31,893 million in the first half of 2025 (2024: € 31,677 million/+0.7%).

In the six-month period, the Financial Services Segment achieved earnings before tax of € 1,192 million (2024: € 1,481 million/-19.5%). In addition to allocations to provisions, the decline in earnings was primarily driven by lower income from the resale of end-of-lease vehicles in the year-on-year comparison, with the number of such vehicles remaining below the previous year's level.

During the reporting period, the credit loss ratio stood at 0.27% across the entire loan portfolio (2024: 0.25%).

BMW Motorrad half-year EBIT margin reported at 12.0%

In the year to the end of June, BMW Motorrad delivered 105,909 motorcycles and scooters to customers (2024: 113,072 units; -6.3%). The segment EBIT margin came in at 12.0% (2024: 11.6%)

BMW AG continues share repurchase programme

The Annual General Meeting in May 2025 authorised the Board of Management to buy back up to 10% of BMW AG's share capital over the next five years. Based on this new authorisation, the Board of Management has approved a third share repurchase programme with a volume of up to € 2 billion, to be completed no later than 30 April 2027. Acquisition of the first tranche of € 750 million began in May 2025 and will be completed no later than December 2025. This underlines the consistent execution of the company’s shareholder return strategy.

BMW Group on course to meet guidance

The latest forecasts of IMF expect a global economic growth of 3.0% this year – eventually impacted by current trade disputes, the potential for higher inflation and ongoing uncertainties among companies and consumers.

The BMW Group expects increasing demand in many markets in 2025, driven by a stabilizing inflation rate and further moderate interest rate cuts. In China, high competition alongside with significant growth are further forecasted, particularly within the lower price segments.

In the USA, permanent tariffs could manifest in rising inflation. US trade policy and potential countermeasures from other countries may lead to slower global economic development.

The forecast published in the BMW Group Report 2024** in March 2025 took into account all tariff increases that had come into effect by [ADDRESS], 2025. Following the announcements on [ADDRESS], 2025, an agreement between the USA and the EU regarding the customs situation has been reached. Based on this, the BMW Group expects a partial reduction of the currently applicable mutual tariffs for automobiles and production parts from 1 August 2025. Due to the dynamic developments and ongoing negotiations, the expected tariff effects for the current fiscal year can still only be represented through assumptions regarding continuing negotiations. The forecast also includes mitigating measures to dampen the impact of the increased tariffs. In the fiscal year 2025, the BMW Group expects a tariff-related impact of approximately to 1.25 percentage points on the EBIT margin in the Automotive segment.

Given the sustained demand for its attractive premium vehicles, the BMW Group is able to confirm its guidance for the year.

The company expects slight growth in sales, with the share of fully electric vehicles in deliveries rising slightly.

Due to the factors mentioned above, Group earnings before tax are expected to be on a par with the previous year .***The EBIT margin for the Automotive Segment is forecast to be within the range of 5.0-7.0%. RoCE should be between 9-13%.

In the Financial Services Segment, RoE is projected to be between 13-16%.

In the Motorcycles Segment , a slight increase in sales and an EBIT margin within the range of 5.5-7.5%are forecast, with a RoCE of 13-17%.

The above targets will be achieved with the current number of employees .

The BMW Group’s actual business performance may deviate from the expectations described above – for example, due to changes in political and macroeconomic conditions. Earnings risks could arise, among other things, from changes in customs policy, while opportunities lie in a reduction of existing tariffs or their validity period.

Deliveries to customers

A new or used vehicle is recorded as a delivery once it is handed over to the end user (which also includes leaseholders under lease contracts with BMW Financial Services). In the US and Canada, end users also include (1) dealers when they designate a vehicle as a service loaner or demonstrator vehicle and (2) dealers and other third parties when they purchase a company vehicle at auction and dealers when they purchase company vehicles directly from the BMW Group. Deliveries may be made by BMW AG, one of its international subsidiaries, a BMW Group retail outlet, or independent third-party dealers. The vast majority of deliveries – and hence the reporting of deliveries to the BMW Group – is made by independent third-party dealers. Retail vehicle deliveries during a given reporting period do not correlate directly to the revenues that the BMW Group recognises in respect of that particular reporting period.

Return on capital employed (RoCE). RoCE in the Automotive and Motorcycles segments is measured on the basis of relevant segment profit before financial result and the average amount of capital employed – at the end of the last five quarters – in the segment concerned. Capital employed corresponds to the sum of all current and non-current operational assets, less liabilities that generally do not incur interest.

Return on equity (RoE). RoE in the Financial Services segment is calculated as segment profit before taxes, divided by the average amount of equity capital – at the end of the last five quarters – attributable to the Financial Services segment.

MINI is celebrating the importance of small spaces in driving change by collaborating with James Stewart, one of the UK’s most prominent broadcasters in science and sustainability to showcase the benefits of Tiny Forests. Nominated by Harvard University as a 'climate creator to watch', James shared his experience exploring three Tiny Forests, using just a single charge of a MINI Countryman Electric – capable of travelling up to 287 miles* (*WLTP combined) – to travel between sites. All three mini spaces James visited were planted as part of MINI UK’s partnership with Earthwatch Europe, with each made up of over 600 densely planted trees in the space the size of a tennis court. With the first planting in 2021, James went to see one site in Newbury and two forests near key manufacturing locations: MINI Plant Oxford and BMW Group Plant Swindon. With up to 1,390 litres of boot capacity to utilise in the MINI Countryman Electric for gardening equipment, James highlights the importance of nature, sustainability, and wildlife preservation through his journey, while measuring how much the saplings at each location have grown since their plantings.

# First IMSA test for the updated BMW M Hybrid V8: New headlights make their debut at Daytona.
## +++ NEW TEST PICTURES ADDED +++ BMW M Team WRT uses the BMW M Hybrid V8 for the first time in the IMSA series during the sanctioned test at Daytona +++ Striking update: the new headlights of the BMW M Hybrid V8 make their debut during nighttime +++ Iconic Yellow Lights continue the tradition of BMW M's racing and high-performance vehicles +++
Date: 2025-11-10 | Author: Andrea Schwab BMW Group | ID: T0453872EN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Munich. This coming weekend, BMW M Team WRT will make its debut with the BMW M Hybrid V8 in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship (IMSA series) during the official sanctioned test at Daytona (USA). The hypercar from BMW M Motorsport will hit the track at the International Speedway sporting its new design and, for the first time, its new headlights. The track lights combine cutting-edge lighting technology with iconic design. Over the two test days, six BMW M works drivers will take the wheel of the two BMW M Hybrid V8s.

The aerodynamic updates to the BMW M Hybrid V8 for the 2026 season were already showcased during previous test drives, including the smaller kidney grille and the modified front splitter designed to optimise airflow and cooling. Now, Daytona will see the addition of another significant update: the new headlights. The advanced technology of the track lights ensures improved visibility for drivers during the numerous night races in the IMSA series and the FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC). These include the 24-hour highlights at Daytona and Le Mans (FRA), as well as the 12 Hours of Sebring (USA), Petit Le Mans in North America, and the FIA WEC events in Qatar and Bahrain. The track lights illuminate the car's surroundings even more brightly, helping drivers better assess race situations, especially in poorly lit sections of the track.

In addition to technological advancements, the new headlights also offer an iconic design element. The yellow accents of the yellow lights pay homage to the current generation of BMW M Motorsport race cars, as the EVO models of the BMW M4 GT3 and BMW M4 GT4 share the same design features. Furthermore, they are a nod to the high-performance vehicles of BMW M GmbH. For example, the current CS models of the BMW M3, BMW M4, and BMW M5 feature yellow headlights, as do BMW M models from previous generations. Alongside the headlights, the kidney grille of the BMW M Hybrid V8 will also stand out at night thanks to its unique contour lighting, BMW Iconic Glow.

On Friday and Saturday, BMW M Team WRT will have five test sessions to gain initial experience with the hypercar on the Daytona International Speedway and familiarise themselves with the procedures of the IMSA series. The Belgian team, which already knows the car well from two seasons in the FIA WEC, will be supported at Daytona by BMW M Team RLL. This collaboration aims to ease and accelerate BMW M Team WRT's adaptation to the IMSA series. Behind the wheel of cars number 24 and 25, BMW M works drivers Philipp Eng (AUT), Robin Frijns (NED), Kevin Magnussen (DEN), René Rast (GER), Dries Vanthoor (BEL), and Marco Wittmann (GER) will alternate during the two test days.

Andreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “I am very excited that we can present and test the update of our BMW M Hybrid V8 at Daytona for the first time in the IMSA environment. The new design and headlights not only look spectacular but are also intended to further optimise performance. We will work hard on this during the test at Daytona, as well as in January during the Roar. The time we have before the 24-hour race at the end of January will be used as effectively as possible to prepare both the cars with their updates and BMW M Team WRT for the first season highlight.”

Date: 2025-11-05 | Author: Britta Ullrich BMW Group | ID: T0453789EN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Munich. The BMW Group’s performance in the year to date has been characterised by robust global sales development, disciplined cost management and a consistent strategic framework.

The Automotive Segment EBIT margin remained within the full-year target range for both the first nine months and the third quarter – despite continuing geopolitical challenges and intensifying competition. Customer deliveries rose slightly year-to-to date at the end of September, while free cash flow in the Automotive Segment stood at € 2,688 million after nine months. On Wednesday, based on these results, the Munich premium manufacturer confirmed its adjusted financial full-year targets announced in October.

“In the third quarter, we once again proved that our business model is robust and resilient”, said [EXECUTIVE_OFFICER], Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG . “We have all the right factors for continued success: a technology-neutral approach, exciting products, a strong global presence and outstanding innovation capabilities throughout the entire value chain. Thanks to our broad model and drive train portfolio, we were able to increase our global sales – with BMW M and our electrified vehicles as the main growth drivers. At the same time, we remain fully on track to meet Europe's ambitious CO 2 targets for 2025 – without relying on flexibility mechanisms or pooling. This demonstrates that our technology-neutral approach is working and delivering strong results.”

Growth in electrified vehicles and M models

Year-on-year, the BMW Group achieved a slight +2.4% increase in deliveries, reaching a total of 1,795,734 vehicles in the YTD September (2024: 1,754,157vehicles). In the third quarter, the premium manufacturer delivered 588,140 BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce vehicles to customers (2024: 540,881 vehicles/ +8.7% ).

The success of the BMW Group's technology-neutral strategy was particularly evident at both ends of the drive train line-up: In the first nine months, the strongest growth came from BMW M models (+7.9%) and from electrified vehicles (+15%). In the year to the end of September, electrified models accounted for 26.2% of total sales (2024: 23.3%), with BEVs representing 18.0% (2024: 16.8%).

In Europe, electrified vehicles gained even higher shares: they made up no less than 40.9% (301,947 units) of all sales while fully-electric vehicles comprised a quarter during the same period (189,269 units; 25,5%).

The BMW Group expects further positive growth momentum in 2026 from the all-new BMW iX3*, the first model of the Neue Klasse.

“The response to the BMW iX3 has been extremely positive: In Europe, new orders significantly exceed our expectations, confirming the strong customer interest,” said CEO Zipse . “With the Neue Klasse, we are making a major leap forward – in technology, driving experience and design. Our entire product line-up will benefit from these innovations within a short timeframe: Between now and 2027, we will bring 40 new and updated models to market – across all segments and drive train variants. Next year, we will already celebrate the next premiere, with the BMW i3, as we electrify the heart of BMW.”

During the nine-month period, the BMW Group benefited from its globally balanced footprint, which helps the company offset differences in sales performance across key regions worldwide. Excluding Chinese sales, the BMW Group brands achieved growth of +8.2% , with solid increases in the key regions of Europe (+8.6%) and the Americas (+9.5%).

In the third quarter, the BMW Group posted revenues of € 32,314 million (Q3 2024: € 32,406 million/-0.3%, adjusted for currency translation effects +3.4% ). Year-to-date at the end of September, revenues were lower than the previous year, at € 99,999 million (2024: € 105,964/-5.6%; adjusted for currency translation effects -3.9% ).

Significantly lower R&D spending and capital expenditure

As previously announced, the BMW Group has transitioned from last year's record levels of future investment, which were required for electrification and digitalisation of the portfolio across all model series, as well as for development of the Neue Klasse.

Expenditure for research and development was down significantly in the first nine months, at € 5,941 million (2024: € 6,642 million/ -10.6% ; Q3 : € 1,921 million ;Q3 2024: € 2,473 million/ -22.3% ) – despite the ongoing product offensive and ramped-up preparations for the first models of the Neue Klasse. The R&D ratio decreased to 5.9% in September MTD as well as YTD (2024: 6.3%/ -0.4 percentage points ; in Q3 2024: 7,6%).

As planned, capital expenditure was also significantly lower, at € 4,410 million for the nine-month period and € 1,674 million for the third quarter (2024: € 5,641 million/ -21,8% ; Q3 2024: € 2,185 million/ -23,4% ). The capex ratio stood at 4.4% for the year to the end of September and 5.2% for the third quarter (2024: 5.3%; Q3 2024: 6.7%).

A capex ratio of less than 6% is forecast for the full year, moving closer to the company’s long-term target range of below 5%, as planned.

The BMW Group also achieved a moderate reduction in sales and administrative expenses , in line with forecasts, bringing costs down to € 6,077 million for the year to the end of September (2024: € 6,587 million/ -7.7% ; in Q3: € 1,995 million ; Q3 2024: € 2,188 million/ -8.8% ).

“As previously announced, this expenditure was lower than last year in every quarter. We are reaping the benefits of having invested in the future early, with the peak now already behind us. In the fourth quarter, we expect further cost reductions, as well as lower research and development spending and capital expenditure. We are systematically managing costs with a measured approach, aiming to continue delivering captivating, innovative premium vehicles – and being consistently profitable,” said Walter Mertl , member of the Board of Management responsible for Finance .

Group pre-tax earnings exceed € 8.0 billion

Group earnings before tax (EBT) totalled € 8,056 million for the first nine months (2024: € 8,861 million/ -9.1% )and € 2,329 million for the third quarter (Q3 2024: € 838 million).

The Group EBT margin came in at 8.1% for the YTD September and 7.2% for the third quarter (2024: 8.4%/ -0.3 percentage points ; Q3 2024: 2.6%/ +4.6% percentage points ). Group net profit amounted to € 5,712 million in the year to the end of September (2024: € 6,132 million/ -6.8% ; in Q3: € 1,697 million ; Q3 2024: € 476 million).

In the first nine months, the Automotive Segment generated revenues of € 87,164 million (2024: € 90,863 million/-4.1%, adjusted for currency translation effects -2.2% ; in Q3: € 28,510 million ; Q3 2024: € 27,854 million/+2.4%, adjusted for currency translation effects +6.4% ). Headwinds resulted from intensified global competition and financial measures aimed at supporting and strengthening dealer profitability in the challenging China market. Volume growth predominantly takes place there in the price segment below RMB 150,000 (~€ 18,000) and the growing product offer of local manufacturers leads to fierce competition across the entire market.

Additionally, negative currency translation effects, particularly from the US dollar, South Korean won and Chinese renminbi, have dampened income.

The segment’s earnings before financial result (EBIT) totalled € 5,120 million for the first nine months (2024: € 6,028 million/ -15.1% ; Q3: € 1,494 million ; Q32024: € 634 million/ [CONTACT_PHONE]% ). In the prior-year quarter, sales and revenues were affected by technical campaigns related to the Integrated Brake System (IBS).

The EBIT margin for the YTD September came in at 5.9% (2024: 6.6%/-0.7 percentage points; in Q3: 5.2% ; Q3 2024: 2.3%/+2.9 percentage points).

Excluding depreciation resulting from the purchase price allocation of BBA of around 1.1 percentage points, the EBIT margin was 7.0% for the year to the end of September and 6.3% for the third quarter. Expenses resulting from higher import tariffs in the United States and the European Union further weighed on these margins: amounting to approx. 1.5 percentage points in the first nine months and around 1.75 percentage points in the third quarter.

Pre-tax earnings and lower capital expenditure boost free cash flow

Free cash flow improved year-on-year, bolstered by higher cash inflows from operating activities, significantly lower investment activity (- € 1.4 billion) and reduced inventory levels, reaching € 2,688 million at the end of the nine-month period. In the third quarter, free cash flow totalled € 343 million (2024: - € 191 million; Q3 2024: - € 2,480 million). For the full year, the segment's free cash flow is now expected to be > € 2.5 billion (previously: > € 5 billion).

The BMW Group is implementing its share buyback programme with continuity and consistency: Following the renewed authorisation of the Annual General Meeting on 14 May 2025, the Board of Management has approved a third share buyback programme, with a volume of up to € 2 billion, to be completed by 30 April 2027. Acquisition of the first tranche of € 750 million began in May 2025 and will be completed no later than 8 December 2025.

As of 30 September 2025, BMW AG held more than 6.2 million treasury shares from the third buyback programme. Based on the authorisation granted at the Annual General Meeting of 14 May 2025, as of 30 September 2025, BMW AG had purchased shares equivalent to 1.01% of the share capital.

“With the third share buyback programme since 2022, the BMW Group is consistently implementing its shareholder return strategy. We remain committed to our shareholders and stand by the announcements we have made. Our employee share programme will also continue,” said CFO Mertl . “At the same time, we are maintaining our payout ratio of 30-40% of net income attributable to BMW AG shareholders.”

Financial Services Segment sees continued new business growth

In the Financial Services Segment , the number of new financing and leasing contracts concluded in the first nine months of the year rose slightly to 1,275,607 (2024: 1,252,251 contracts/ +1.9% ). This significant growth in new business in the third quarter ( 450,935 contracts/ +12.1% ) was mainly due to a shift in the Chinese competitive landscape, where local banks have substantially reduced their commission rates for brokering financial and insurance products to retail customers.

The segment's volume of new business also increased slightly to € 48,500 million after nine months (2024: € 46,531 million/ +4.2% ). This reflects growth in new contracts, with a higher financing amount per contract. The penetration rate increased to 46.4% (2024: 42.3%/ +4.1 percentage points ).

For the year to the end of September, the segment reported pre-tax earnings (EBT) of € 1,836 million (2024: € 2,146 million/ -14.4% ). This dampening effect was mainly due to lower income from the resale of end-of-lease vehicles, with the number of returned vehicles below the previous year's level. For the nine-month period, the credit loss ratio was in line with the previous year, at 0.26% , across the entire finance portfolio (2024: 0.26%).

BMW Motorrad posts higher margin in YTD September

[ADDRESS],156 deliveries in the year to the end of September, BMW Motorrad achieved an EBIT margin of 10.8% (2024: 9.5%/ +1.3 percentage points ).

Full-year guidance for 2025

[ADDRESS] October, the BMW Group adjusted its annual guidance for the following KPIs:

Despite lower volume expectations for the Chinese market in the fourth quarter, the BMW Group is still targeting slight sales growth for the full year .

In the Automotive Segment , the EBIT margin for 2025 is still forecast to be within the guided target range of 5-7%, more specifically in the range of 5% to 6% in light of the earnings headwinds mentioned previously.

In the Financial Services Segment , Return on Equity is projected to be between 13-16%.

In the Motorcycles Segment , an EBIT margin within the range of 5.5-7.5%is forecast as before, with a RoCE of 13-17%. The segment is now anticipating a slight decrease in customer deliveries (previously: slight increase).

The BMW Group’s actual business performance may deviate from the expectations outlined above – for example, due to changes in political and macroeconomic conditions. Risks to earnings could arise, among other factors, from changes in tariff policy or Chinese export restrictions affecting rare earths, battery cell production or semiconductors. At the same time, opportunities could result from a reduction in existing tariffs or a shorter period of validity. The company continues to monitor macroeconomic developments very closely.

The BMW Group will continue to benefit from its young and attractive product line-up and from its proven technology-neutral approach. At the same time, thanks to its flexibility, globally balanced footprint and strong financial position, the company is able to adapt to dynamic market conditions, while consistently pursuing long-term success.

Munich. The BMW Group showed strong resilience in the first half of the year – building on a solid foundation of consistent strategy, robust customer demand, sustained cost discipline and high flexibility. With sales volumes stable at over 1.2 million premium vehicles, and with potential for further growth, the company reported Group earnings before tax of more than € 5.7 billion and an EBT margin of 8.5% in the first six months of 2025.

The Automotive Segment EBIT margin came in at 6.2%, placing it in the upper half of the 5.0-7.0% annual target range, published in March. The segment's free cash flow for the first half-year was € 2.345 billion. At the six-month mark, the BMW Group is therefore on track to meet its targets for the year. "Our performance in the first half of 2025 once again underscores the robustness of our business model. Our success today, as well as in the future, is based on three strong pillars: our global footprint, our strength in innovation, and our technology-neutral approach with highly attractive products," said [EXECUTIVE_OFFICER], Chairman of the Board of BMW AG . "In September, we will begin a new era for BMW when the first vehicle of the NEUE KLASSE makes its debut at the IAA Mobility. With the BMW iX3*, we are kicking off an unprecedented product ramp-up: by 2027, we will launch more than 40 new and revised models across all segments and drive types. Each vehicle will embody the innovative technology clusters and the new design language. This way, we connect technological advancement and exciting products with strategic foresight and economic efficiency."

By offering different drive technologies and a comprehensive range of models, the premium manufacturer from Munich is able to meet diverse customer preferences, reporting growth across numerous markets: Outside of China, BMW deliveries rose across all sales regions, with the brand recording slight growth of +4.7% .

Benefiting from full availability of the New MINI Family, the British cult brand reported significant growth of 17.4% in the first half of the year, with a total of 133,838 vehicles sold. MINI deliveries increased in all regions of the world.

In Europe , the BMW Group posted solid sales growth of +8.2% , with 498,670 units sold (Q2 deliveries: 256,487 units; +10.2%). In the Americas region, deliveries increased by +3.4% to 237,972 vehicles (Q2: 123,254 units; +1.7%).

Deliveries in the US market rose by +2.7% year-on-year, with a total of 193,826 vehicles delivered to customers (Q2: 98,856 units; +1.4%).

Electrified models and BMW M vehicles with increased sales volumes

With a 26.4% share (Q2: 26.0%) of total sales in the first six months, more than one in four BMW Group vehicles delivered – precisely 319,031 units – was electrified. Europe recorded the highest growth rates for BEVs and PHEVs, at 34,8%.

Alongside electrified vehicles (+6.5%), the high-performance models of the BMW M brand were the main growth drivers for the BMW brand: With nearly 106,000 vehicles sold (+6.5% compared to HY1 2024), BMW M GmbH reported the highest first-half-year sales in its history. The BMW M3* and BMW M3 Touring*, together with the BMW M5* and BMW M5 Touring* introduced at the start of the year, made a significant contribution to this result.

MINI grows with BEV models

MINI’s sales growth also stemmed mainly from MINI BEVs : the MINI Cooper Electric*, the MINI Aceman Electric* and the MINI Countryman Electric*. With a 34.3% share in the first half-year, more than one in three MINIs delivered to customers worldwide was battery-electric.

In the first half of 2025, the Rolls-Royce brand built on the previous year’s strong sales performance, delivering 2,796 handcrafted luxury motor cars to customers (-0.8%). In the second quarter, it increased its sales by +9.4% year-on-year to 1,415 units.

The growing percentage of electrified vehicles confirms the BMW Group's successful approach of offering its customers a broad range of models, all available with different drive technologies. More than 15 fully-electric vehicles and 12 PHEVs are currently available. In the second quarter of 2025, the BMW Group reached a major milestone in its drive train strategy, with the delivery of its 1.5-millionth BEV since the launch of the first BMW i3 in 2013.

Group EBT margin of 8.5% in first half-year

Group revenues for the first half-year totalled € 67,685 million(2024: € 73,558 million/-8.0%; adjusted for currency translation effects: -7.1%; Q2 : € 33,927 million; Q2 2024: € 36,944 million; -8.2%; adjusted for currency translation effects: -5.5%).

Compared with the previous year, revenues were pressured by currency translation headwinds and the expected subdued demand in China. The positive impact of strong growth in new leasing business at BMW Group Financial Services resulted in higher revenue eliminations between segments, which dampened Group revenues.

Following a peak in R&D spending and capital expenditure in 2024, this trend was reversed, as expected, in the first half of the year – without compromising the premium manufacturer's commitment to innovation leadership.

Driven by a strong operating performance, the BMW Group’s expenditure for research and development totalled € 4,020 million in the first six months of the year (2024: € 4,169 million/-3.6%). This figure was down slightly on the previous year, despite intensive preparations for the upcoming models of the NEUE KLASSE, including the BMW iX3 and other successor models. R&D spending focused on digitalisation of the vehicle fleet and electrification across all model series. As planned, administrative and sales expenses were reduced, and capital expenditure for property, plant and equipment also declined.

Between January and June, the BMW Group reported pre-tax earnings (EBT) of € 5,727 million (2024: € 8,023 million/-28.6%; Q2 : € 2,614 million; Q2 2024: € 3,861 million; -32.3%).

The EBT margin for the first half year was 8.5% (2024: 10.9%; in Q2 : 7.7%; Q2 2024: 10.5%). Group net profit for the first half of the year totalled € 4,015 million (2024: € 5,656 million/-29.0%; Q2 : € 1,842 million/-31.9%).

Automotive Segment EBIT margin within annual target range

In the first half of the year, the Automotive Segment generated revenues of € 58,654 million (2024: € 63,009 million/-6.9%; adjusted for currency translation effects: -5.9%; Q2 : € 29,443 million; -8.2%; adjusted for currency translation effects: -5.3%). This year-on-year decrease was mainly due to currency translation headwinds and due to the expected decline in sales revenues in China.

Segment earnings before financial result (EBIT) for the first half-year amounted to € 3,626 million (2024: € 5,394 million/-32.8%; Q2 : € 1,602 million; -40.3%). The EBIT margin came in at 6.2% (2024: 8.6%; Q2: 5.4%). Excluding depreciation and amortisation from the BBA purchase price allocation , the EBIT margin for the first half-year was 7.3% . The impact of tariff increases – particularly the European Commission’s anti-subsidy measures on Chinese BEVs and the sharp rise in US tariff duties – created headwinds in the automotive segment corresponding to the amount of around 1.5%-points of its EBIT margin in the first half-year. “Even despite higher tariffs, the BMW Group’s business model remains intact – our popular premium vehicles, global competitive strength and high level of resilience provide us with a strong and sustainable foundation. Our footprint in the US is helping us limit the impact of tariffs,” said Walter Mertl, member of the Board of Management responsible for Finance, during the quarterly conference call in Munich. “Thanks to precise financial control, based on calculated forecasts, we are firmly on track to achieve our targets for the year at the six-month mark. Higher efficiency and optimised cost structures also contribute to achieving our financial goals.”

Free cash flow of € 2,345 million in Automotive Segment in YTD June

After six months, free cash flow in the Automotive Segment totalled € 2,345 million (2024: € 2,289 million) and was thus on track for the annual guidance.

The BMW Group is still targeting a free cash flow of > € 5 billion in the Automotive Segment for the full year.

From January to June, capital expenditure for property, plant and equipment and intangible assets amounted to € 2,736 million (2024: € 3,456 million/-20,8%). The capex ratio came in at 4.0% (Q2: 4.5%; HY1 2024: 4.7%; Q2 2024: 5.8%).

Dynamic performance continues in Financial Services Segment

In the Financial Services Segment , dynamic growth in new leasing business continued in the first six months of the year: The volume of new leasing business rose significantly (+9.5%), with the leasing share of total new business increasing to 40.0% (2024: 35.5%/+4.5% percentage points). The segment concluded a total of 824,672 new financing and leasing contracts worldwide in the first half of the year (2024: 849,908 contracts/-3.0%). This represents a slight year-on-year decrease, owing to the lower number of new contracts concluded in China.

The percentage of new BMW Group vehicles leased or financed by the Financial Services Segment reached 43.7% by the end of the reporting period (2024: 41.2%/+2.5 percentage points). Thanks to a higher financed amount per vehicle, the volume of new business remained stable at € 31,893 million in the first half of 2025 (2024: € 31,677 million/+0.7%).

In the six-month period, the Financial Services Segment achieved earnings before tax of € 1,192 million (2024: € 1,481 million/-19.5%). In addition to allocations to provisions, the decline in earnings was primarily driven by lower income from the resale of end-of-lease vehicles in the year-on-year comparison, with the number of such vehicles remaining below the previous year's level.

During the reporting period, the credit loss ratio stood at 0.27% across the entire loan portfolio (2024: 0.25%).

BMW Motorrad half-year EBIT margin reported at 12.0%

In the year to the end of June, BMW Motorrad delivered 105,909 motorcycles and scooters to customers (2024: 113,072 units; -6.3%). The segment EBIT margin came in at 12.0% (2024: 11.6%)

BMW AG continues share repurchase programme

The Annual General Meeting in May 2025 authorised the Board of Management to buy back up to 10% of BMW AG's share capital over the next five years. Based on this new authorisation, the Board of Management has approved a third share repurchase programme with a volume of up to € 2 billion, to be completed no later than 30 April 2027. Acquisition of the first tranche of € 750 million began in May 2025 and will be completed no later than December 2025. This underlines the consistent execution of the company’s shareholder return strategy.

BMW Group on course to meet guidance

The latest forecasts of IMF expect a global economic growth of 3.0% this year – eventually impacted by current trade disputes, the potential for higher inflation and ongoing uncertainties among companies and consumers.

The BMW Group expects increasing demand in many markets in 2025, driven by a stabilizing inflation rate and further moderate interest rate cuts. In China, high competition alongside with significant growth are further forecasted, particularly within the lower price segments.

In the USA, permanent tariffs could manifest in rising inflation. US trade policy and potential countermeasures from other countries may lead to slower global economic development.

The forecast published in the BMW Group Report 2024** in March 2025 took into account all tariff increases that had come into effect by [ADDRESS], 2025. Following the announcements on [ADDRESS], 2025, an agreement between the USA and the EU regarding the customs situation has been reached. Based on this, the BMW Group expects a partial reduction of the currently applicable mutual tariffs for automobiles and production parts from 1 August 2025. Due to the dynamic developments and ongoing negotiations, the expected tariff effects for the current fiscal year can still only be represented through assumptions regarding continuing negotiations. The forecast also includes mitigating measures to dampen the impact of the increased tariffs. In the fiscal year 2025, the BMW Group expects a tariff-related impact of approximately to 1.25 percentage points on the EBIT margin in the Automotive segment.

Given the sustained demand for its attractive premium vehicles, the BMW Group is able to confirm its guidance for the year.

The company expects slight growth in sales, with the share of fully electric vehicles in deliveries rising slightly.

Due to the factors mentioned above, Group earnings before tax are expected to be on a par with the previous year .***The EBIT margin for the Automotive Segment is forecast to be within the range of 5.0-7.0%. RoCE should be between 9-13%.

In the Financial Services Segment, RoE is projected to be between 13-16%.

In the Motorcycles Segment , a slight increase in sales and an EBIT margin within the range of 5.5-7.5%are forecast, with a RoCE of 13-17%.

The above targets will be achieved with the current number of employees .

The BMW Group’s actual business performance may deviate from the expectations described above – for example, due to changes in political and macroeconomic conditions. Earnings risks could arise, among other things, from changes in customs policy, while opportunities lie in a reduction of existing tariffs or their validity period. The company continues to monitor macroeconomic developments very closely.

**see BMW Group Report 2024, p.261.

***As of 1 January 2025, the forecast range for Group EBT has been adjusted. For details, please refer to the glossary in the BMW Group Report 2024.

GLOSSARY – explanatory comments on key performance indicators

Battery Electric Vehicle. Deliveries to customers

A new or used vehicle is recorded as a delivery once it is handed over to the end user (which also includes leaseholders under lease contracts with BMW Financial Services). In the US and Canada, end users also include (1) dealers when they designate a vehicle as a service loaner or demonstrator vehicle and (2) dealers and other third parties when they purchase a company vehicle at auction and dealers when they purchase company vehicles directly from the BMW Group. Deliveries may be made by BMW AG, one of its international subsidiaries, a BMW Group retail outlet, or independent third-party dealers. The vast majority of deliveries – and hence the reporting of deliveries to the BMW Group – is made by independent third-party dealers. Retail vehicle deliveries during a given reporting period do not correlate directly to the revenues that the BMW Group recognises in respect of that particular reporting period.

Profit before financial result. Profit before financial result comprises revenues less cost of sales, less selling and administrative expenses and plus/minus net other operating income and expenses.

EBIT margin

Profit/loss before financial result as a percentage of revenues.

EBIT plus financial result.

Profit/loss as a percentage of revenues.

Plug-in-hybrid electric vehicle.

Return on capital employed (RoCE). RoCE in the Automotive and Motorcycles segments is measured on the basis of relevant segment profit before financial result and the average amount of capital employed – at the end of the last five quarters – in the segment concerned. Capital employed corresponds to the sum of all current and non-current operational assets, less liabilities that generally do not incur interest.

Return on equity (RoE). RoE in the Financial Services segment is calculated as segment profit before taxes, divided by the average amount of equity capital – at the end of the last five quarters – attributable to the Financial Services segment.

# From pilot fleet to series production: the new BMW iX5 Hydrogen
## +++ Technology-open approach as strategic success factor +++ For the first time at BMW: five drivetrain variants in one vehicle +++ HyMoS initiative to promote development of local hydrogen ecosystems +++
Date: 2025-09-22 | Author: Lisa Aigner BMW Group | ID: T0452737EN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Munich. The BMW Group is launching a vehicle with five different drivetrain technologies. The new BMW X5 will be the first model to offer customers a choice of battery electric, plug-in hybrid, petrol, diesel, and hydrogen fuel cell technology. The HyMoS (Hydrogen Mobility at Scale) initiative is designed to promote the development of hydrogen ecosystems and refueling stations in metropolitan areas and aims for an initial pilot implementation in Germany.

“By launching the new BMW X5 with a choice of five drive system variants, we are once again demonstrating our leading position as a technology pioneer,” says Joachim Post, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Development at an BMW event in New York. “Hydrogen has an essential part to play in global decarbonisation, which is why we are committed to driving the technology forward.”

Technology-open approach is a strategic success factor

Product diversity continues to be a key success factor for the BMW Group. A wide-ranging portfolio of drive systems – encompassing ICE engines, plug-in hybrids, battery electric drive systems and, starting with the new BMW iX5 Hydrogen in 2028 , hydrogen fuel cell technology – lays the foundations for successfully meeting the varying demands and needs of customers worldwide both now and in the future.

Flexible manufacturing structures and high levels of integration expertise enable this array of drive technologies to be implemented efficiently in the new BMW X5 range in terms of development, purchasing and production. This means the BMW model line-up will include two types of fully electric drivetrain (battery electric and hydrogen fuel cell) from 2028, underlining the rigorous application of the brand’s technology-open approach.

The new BMW iX5 Hydrogen

Following successful testing of the pilot fleet worldwide, the new BMW iX5 Hydrogen* will enter the market as the brand’s first-ever series-produced hydrogen-powered model. “ The new BMW iX5 Hydrogen will be a true BMW - pioneering in its class and delivering the BMW typical driving pleasure,” says Michael Rath, Vice President Hydrogen Vehicles BMW Group .

The drive technology is based on the third-generation fuel cell system that the BMW Group is developing in collaboration with the Toyota Motor Corporation.This technological advance paves the way for a system with a more compact design that is also more powerful and efficient, thereby increasing range and output at the same time as reducing energy consumption. The company’s competence centres in Munich and in the BMW Group Plant Steyr are already building first prototypes. Further drive system components will come from the BMW Group plant in Landshut.

Benefits of hydrogen-powered technology

Hydrogen is recognized as a promising future energy carrier for global decarbonization. It acts as an effective storage medium for renewable energy sources, helping to balance supply and demand and enabling a more stable and reliable integration of renewables into the energy grid. Hydrogen is the missing piece for completing the electric mobility puzzle where battery electric drive systems are not an optimal solution.

HyMoS initiative: alliance for strengthening the hydrogen infrastructure

As well as developing the new BMW iX5 Hydrogen, BMW is also actively involved in efforts to expand the hydrogen refueling network. The HyMoS (Hydrogen Mobility at Scale) initiative was established to support hydrogen ecosystems for mobility in cooperation with industry and institutional partners. The aim of this initiative is to increase the economic viability of hydrogen mobility ecosystems by pooling the demand for all types of vehicles, including trucks, buses and passenger cars. This will help to reach an optimal distribution and usage of hydrogen stations. The initiative supports existing hydrogen ecosystem projects in achieving their full potential by sharing experiences across projects and providing ground support of its industry partners. A pilot phase started with the support of existing ecosystems in Germany and France to gather experiences for deployment to further metropolitan areas and a potential later expansion to other countries.

# CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO | “Upper Echelon: BMW Group revives Rolls-Royce Motor Cars for the modern era”.
## Of all the world’s automotive nameplates, none is more revered than that of Rolls-Royce. Since 1904, Rolls-Royce automobiles have occupied a class of their own where quality and elegance are concerned, and the Rolls-Royce name is virtually synonymous with luxury. For an automaker like BMW, a high-end marque like Rolls-Royce would constitute the perfect British bookend to the compact MINI, which it purchased as part of its 1994 acquisition of the Rover Group. As such, Rolls-Royce became an important target during the second phase of BMW’s expansion program of the 1990s.

Woodcliff Lake, NJ - [ADDRESS], 2025... Of all the world’s automotive nameplates, none is more revered than that of Rolls-Royce. Since 1904, Rolls-Royce automobiles have occupied a class of their own where quality and elegance are concerned, and the Rolls-Royce name is virtually synonymous with luxury. For an automaker like BMW, a high-end marque like Rolls-Royce would constitute the perfect British bookend to the compact MINI, which it purchased as part of its 1994 acquisition of the Rover Group. As such, Rolls-Royce became an important target during the second phase of BMW’s expansion program of the 1990s. Like nearly all automotive nameplates, Rolls-Royce was founded by an inventive individual. Henry Royce built his first automobile in Manchester, England in 1904, and two years later he was joined by a partner, Charles Rolls. Royce’s firm became Rolls-Royce Ltd., which began manufacturing airplane engines as well as automobiles in 1914, when Great Britain entered World War I. In 1931, Rolls-Royce added to its portfolio by buying the smaller Bentley automotive company, then on the verge of bankruptcy during the Great Depression. Rolls-Royce’s airplane engine business helped the company flourish during World War II, and to acquire coachbuilders Park Ward and Mulliner shortly after the war ended. Its prosperity wouldn’t survive the prolonged austerity of the postwar period, however, and financial troubles saw Rolls-Royce taken over by the British government in 1971. In 1980, the government sold Rolls-Royce to Vickers PLC, a defense and industrial concern that was otherwise uninvolved with the automobile business. As that suggests, Vickers lacked the expertise or the resources needed to modernize the cars sold under the Rolls-Royce or Bentley nameplates, both of which it acquired in the same transaction. As Tony Lewin reported in The Complete Book of BMW , BMW offered to buy 20 percent of Rolls and Bentley in the early 1990s, but Vickers wanted to sell the entire automotive operation. BMW remained interested, however, and began sharing technology, components, and testing facilities with Vickers. That collaboration resulted in the 5 Series-based 1994 Bentley Java concept and two 1998 automobiles: the BMW V12-powered Rolls-Royce Silver Seraph and the BMW V8-powered Bentley Arnage. Despite those ties, BMW almost lost out to Volkswagen when Vickers sold both Rolls and Bentley to the Wolfsburg manufacturer in 1998. Fortunately for BMW, Volkswagen failed to notice that the Rolls-Royce brand name hadn’t been included in the €430 million sale. The brand name, and the famous “RR” logo, belonged not to Vickers but to a separate entity: Rolls-Royce PLC, a maker of aircraft engines and a partner with BMW in the aerospace industry. For £40 million, BMW licensed the rights to the Rolls-Royce name and logo. Now the company could create its own all-new Rolls-Royce automobile, a factory in which to build it, and a sales and distribution organization to bring it to market.

# “Just ask Factory Genius!”: How AI helps maintain manufacturing equipment
## +++ AI maintenance assistant Factory Genius speeds up troubleshooting at BMW Group +++ Pilot project at Plant Dingolfing forms basis of company-wide solution +++ Methodology can be transferred to other areas +++
Date: 2025-07-02 | Author: Benedikt Torka BMW Group | ID: T0451181EN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Munich. Whenever vehicle production equipment fails at a BMW Group plant, every minute counts. The maintenance team must work quickly to identify and resolve the cause of the fault. Now, employees can ask the new digital AI assistant, “Factory Genius”, for help: It can suggest solutions for the specific system problem within seconds, reducing the time required for error diagnosis to a minimum. “AI applications have become an integral part of modern production systems and are a key element of the BMW Group’s digital transformation. Factory Genius is an example of how generative AI, in particular, can streamline operations for everyone involved and enhance economic efficiency,” says Michael Ströbel, head of Process Management and Digitalisation, Order to Delivery at the BMW Group. But how exactly does the digital assistant, recently launched in its initial development phase, support maintenance staff? Knowledge discovery tool

The tool essentially works like a search engine, quickly filtering relevant answers to specific user queries from a vast amount of data and user reports. However, this search function does not draw content and information from the internet, but from equipment manuals, quality data, internal fault reports and planning documents it was previously trained on. To keep the data management system up to date, it is regularly fed with new knowledge – for example, in the form of daily-updated shift-log data. By integrating a Large Language Model, similar to those used in chatbots like ChatGPT and Gemini, Factory Genius is also able to understand language: The software can search data for relevant content within the appropriate linguistic context, providing more accurate results than a conventional search engine. In addition to displaying the top matches with links to sources, the assistant can also summarise the maintenance instructions found through contextual search in just a few sentences, if preferred. The user can then ask questions in a chat. Collaborative in-house development

A pilot project in the body shop at BMW Group Plant Dingolfing laid the groundwork for this in-house development. Alongside the tool developed in Dingolfing in spring 2024, other BMW Group locations, including the plants in Spartanburg, USA, and Rosslyn, South Africa, were working at the same time on similar solutions through a transparent process. All were pursuing the same goal: improving access to information when faults occur or during scheduled training and maintenance. AI experts at the company’s Munich headquarters consolidated this expertise, integrating the plants’ diverse requirements to create a company-wide “best of” application. This can now be used globally in its initial development phase through an internal platform.

In addition to search and chat functionality, Factory Genius also features a translation function, enabling it to switch languages at any time to overcome language barriers. This functionality has proven extremely useful while building the new plant in Debrecen, Hungary, for example, since manuals are often not available in Hungarian. Transferable methodology

The technology behind Factory Genius has the potential to be applied to other production use cases as well. The general approach enables integration of a wide range of documents and development of assistants tailored to different user groups. Thanks to its cloud functionality, the tool will also be rapidly available worldwide.

# The first-ever BMW M3 CS Touring: Racing DNA meets maximised everyday usability.
## With the first-ever BMW M3 CS Touring (fuel consumption combined: 10.5 l/100 km [26.9 mpg imp]; CO2 emissions combined: 238 g/km in the WLTP cycle, CO2 class: G), BMW M GmbH is adding another special-edition model to its line-up in the high-performance sports car segment. The latest new addition to the manufacturer’s most popular range builds on the success of the BMW M3 Competition Touring with M xDrive (fuel consumption combined: 10.4 l/100 km [27.2 mpg imp]; CO2 emissions combined: 235 g/km in the WLTP cycle, CO2 class: G) and blends that car’s very distinctive character profile with even greater potential for emotionally exhilarating performance. A 405 kW/550 hp six-cylinder in-line engine, bespoke chassis tuning, exclusive design features and weight savings resulting from the use of numerous carbon fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP) components provide the ingredients for an unadulterated racing-car feeling. The on-board space of the first-ever BMW M3 CS Touring can be used in a wide variety of ways, which ensures that its ultra-dynamic driving characteristics can be experienced both on the race track and in myriad everyday situations, during leisure activities and on trips away.
Date: 2025-02-04 | Author: Christian Pomp BMW Group | ID: T0447881EN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The model-specific performance characteristics of the engine and power transfer via the eight-speed M Steptronic transmission and M xDrive all-wheel-drive system serve up dynamic thrills and supreme traction. The BMW M3 CS Touring races from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 3.5 seconds.

The world premiere of the first-ever BMW M3 CS Touring will be hosted by the Mount Panorama Circuit in Bathurst, in the Australian state of New South Wales. The BMW M3 CS Touring will be revealed to the public for the first time on 30 January 2025 as part of the [ADDRESS] Hour race programme. Deliveries of the limited-run model to customers in Europe, Australia, Japan and South Korea, among others, will begin in March 2025. The car’s home market of Germany is by a distance its most important sales region. The special edition will be produced alongside all other variants of the BMW M3 Sedan and BMW M3 Touring at BMW Group Plant Munich.

Six-cylinder in-line engine adapts racing-car technology.

[ADDRESS].0-litre six-cylinder in-line engine in the BMW M3 CS Touring was designed from the outset to deliver high performance on the race track – and it features a multitude of technological details from racing-car design. These include an extremely rigid crankcase with a sleeve-free, closed-deck construction, a forged lightweight crankshaft and a cylinder head with a 3D-printed core. The likewise weight-saving cylinder bores have a wire-arc sprayed iron coating to reduce frictional losses. The cooling system and oil supply are also designed to handle the sustained heavy loads generated during hard driving on a track.

The drive unit combines the high-revving characteristics for which M is renowned and linear power delivery into the upper reaches of the engine’s range with upgraded M TwinTurbo technology. Raising the maximum charge pressure of the two mono-scroll turbochargers to 2.1 bar and making model-specific tweaks to the engine management enable the maximum output of the BMW M3 Competition Touring with M xDrive to be increased by another 15 kW/20 hp to 405 kW/550 hp. The engine develops its peak torque of 650 Nm (479 lb-ft) between just 2,750 and 5,950 rpm, produces its maximum output at 6,250 rpm and tops out at 7,200 rpm.

In addition, a specially designed engine mounting with increased spring rates creates an extremely rigid connection between the power unit and the vehicle’s structure. This leads to even sharper engine response and extremely direct transmission of its power to the drivetrain. Its instantaneous power delivery means the BMW M3 CS Touring can power from rest to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 3.5 seconds, and 0 to 200 km/h (124 mph) is over in 11.7 seconds. The figures recorded using the “one-foot rollout” method* are 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 3.2 seconds and 0 to 200 km/h (124 mph) in 11.4 seconds. The mid-range sprint from 80 to 120 km/h (50 – 75 mph) takes 2.7 seconds in 4th gear and 3.5 seconds in 5th gear. The top speed of the special-edition model – which comes as standard with the M Driver’s Package – is electronically limited to 300 km/h (186 mph).

The car’s emotionally stirring engine note is the work of the M-specific exhaust system featuring electrically controlled flaps, a titanium rear silencer with weight-minimising design and – in customary M fashion – two pairs of tailpipes painted in matt Black. The engine’s acoustic presence varies according to the engine profile the driver selects from the M Setup menu. SPORT or SPORT+ mode produces a drive sound that injects real aural drama into proceedings, particularly through gear changes and the accompanying adjustments in rev speed.

Eight-speed M Steptronic transmission, M xDrive and Active M Differential enable irresistibly dynamic power transfer.

The engine under the bonnet of the BMW M3 CS Touring teams up with an eight-speed M Steptronic transmission including Drivelogic. The Drivelogic button integrated into the gear selector lever makes it possible to alter the transmission’s shift characteristics, with a choice of three clearly distinguishable settings available. As well as comfort-focused and sporty options, drivers can also engage a setting optimised specially for track driving. Both the selector lever and the carbon-fibre shift paddles on the steering wheel enable sequential interventions in the gear selection process.

The BMW M3 CS Touring channels its power to the road through the M xDrive all-wheel-drive system. This employs an electronically controlled multi-plate clutch in the transfer case to ensure fully variable and super-smooth distribution of the engine’s power between the front and rear wheels, and serves up tireless all-wheel-drive performance, even during hard track sessions. In tandem with the Active M Differential at the rear axle – whose operation is also fully variable – the intelligent all-wheel-drive system’s rear-wheel bias enhances the M-typical handling dynamics. Added to which, 4WD Sport mode can be selected via the M Setup menu. This sends an even greater proportion of the engine’s power to the rear wheels. 2WD mode, meanwhile, delivers a driving experience for the ultimate purist, laying on classical rear-wheel drive with the DSC (Dynamic Stability Control) system deactivated.

Model-specific tuning for the chassis technology and performance-focused stopping power.

The chassis technology in the BMW M3 CS Touring has been tuned precisely to the engine’s performance characteristics, the overall vehicle concept and the specific weight distribution of this latest special-edition model. The settings for the DSC system and M Dynamic Mode have also been purposefully optimised for the specific demands of dynamically committed circuit driving. The electronically controlled dampers of the adaptive M suspension on the BMW M3 CS Touring likewise come in a model-specific setup, as do its M Servotronic steering and integrated braking system.

Providing outstanding stopping power are M Compound brakes with callipers painted in a choice of Red or Black. There is also the option of M Carbon ceramic brakes whose brake callipers are available in Red or matt Gold. Also on the standard equipment list are forged M light-alloy wheels in an exclusive double-spoke design with a matt Gold Bronze or matt Black finish. [ADDRESS] inches in diameter at the front axle and 20 inches at the rear, the wheels are fitted as standard with track tyres (275/35 ZR19 at the front, 285/30 ZR20 at the rear). As an alternative to these tyres, customers also have the no-cost option of sport tyres with the same dimensions. And ultra-track tyres are also included on the options list.

Exclusive carbon-fibre components and optimised body rigidity help to produce outstanding performance attributes.

Together with the extremely powerful engine and model-specific chassis technology, intelligent lightweight design measures also play a major part in moulding the exclusive performance attributes of the BMW M3 CS Touring. Extensive use of carbon fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP) is particularly important when it comes to weight minimisation. The car’s bonnet, front splitter, front air intakes, exterior mirror caps and rear diffuser are all made from CFRP.

Inside the cabin, the M Carbon bucket seats and likewise CFRP steering wheel shift paddles, interior trim strips and centre console also do their bit to keep weight down. The various lightweight design measures bring about a total weight saving of some 15 kilograms over the BMW M3 Competition Touring with M xDrive. Body rigidity is further increased by specifying the optional M front end strut brace for the engine compartment that has also been engineered for lightness.

Exquisite balance of performance and everyday usability; exclusive design features.

Hallmark M performance and the versatility-focused body concept of a Touring model certainly make an unusual combination, and the latest special edition adds a special allure to the mix. In the BMW M3 CS Touring, a concentrated dose of M feeling meets a variable-usage interior whose storage capacity below the high-opening tailgate can be expanded from 500 litres to a maximum 1,510 litres. In addition, the dynamically stretched lines of the Touring model and the M-specific exterior details – crafted precisely to meet the technical demands of cooling air supply and aerodynamic balance – are complemented by exclusive design features whose striking appearance reflects the track-leaning instincts of the BMW M3 CS Touring.

For example, the standard-specification exposed carbon fibre of the special-edition’s bonnet, front splitter, front air intakes and M exterior mirror caps creates an eye-catching contrast against the visually striking exterior colours available for the rest of the car. The BMW M3 CS Touring can be ordered with a paint finish in British Racing Green, Laguna Seca Blue, Frozen Solid White or Sapphire Black metallic. The roof and model-specific roof spoiler are in Black high-gloss and bring an impression of elegance to the bold exterior. Another exclusive design feature of the special-edition model is the red surround for the roof spoiler.

The front end of the car is defined by the weight-minimised, ultra-stripped-back and frameless BMW M kidney grille. The black model lettering on the upper of the two horizontal grille slats is bordered by a red contour line, likewise the model badging at the front and rear. In a clear reference to motor sport, the LED headlights of the BMW M3 CS Touring glow with the same distinctive yellow light as GT racing cars.

Driver-focused cockpit with exclusive racing-car aura.

The interior of the BMW M3 CS Touring blends a sports-car cockpit designed to exude maximum performance with digital technology and exclusive design features. Electrically adjustable and heated M Carbon bucket seats are fitted as standard for the driver and front passenger. They have integral head restraints, an illuminated “CS” model badge and surfaces in Merino leather. Their exclusive Black/Red design is also adopted by the rear seats, while all the door panel trim is covered with black leather.

The standard M Alcantara steering wheel in three-spoke design – with its flat-bottomed rim and red centre marker in the 12-o’clock position – brings authentic racing car flair into the cockpit,. Further M-specific details are the red “CS” badge on the centre console, M seat belts and door sill plates with model lettering.

The M-specific Setup button on the centre console enables direct access to the settings for the engine, chassis, steering, brakes and M xDrive. Two individually configurable setup variants can be stored together with personal settings for the engine sound, DSC, Automatic Start/Stop function and the shift characteristics of the eight-speed M Steptronic transmission – and these setups are then selected using the M buttons on the steering wheel. The BMW M3 CS Touring also comes as standard with the M Drive Professional system with track-optimised functions such as the M Drift Analyser and M Laptimer. Added to which, the 10-stage M Traction Control delivers personalised driving fun on the track. Another feature of M Drive Professional is the M Mode button on the centre console, which can be used to configure the driver assistance systems and the content shown on the information display and Head-Up Display. Drivers can choose between ROAD, SPORT and TRACK settings here.

In the new BMW M3 CS Touring, the latest version of the display and control/operation system BMW iDrive based on BMW Operating [ADDRESS].5 provides intuitive control of numerous vehicle functions and digital services. With the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant and BMW Curved Display both on board, the car is based squarely on operation using touch control and natural language. The M-specific view on the 12.3-inch information display shows the familiar M Shift Lights at its upper edge, while the status of the driving stability systems, M xDrive and traction control can be found at the lower edge of the screen. The home screen of the 14.9-inch control display includes widgets for the vehicle setup, tire pressure and temperature.

Sophisticated options for enhancing driving pleasure and comfort in everyday use.

Standard specification for the BMW M3 CS Touring also includes BMW Live Cockpit Professional which, alongside the BMW Head-Up Display with M-specific content, brings the cloud-based navigation system BMW Maps, smartphone integration, telephony with wireless charging and a WiFi interface. The BMW Drive Recorder can be added as an option.

The BMW M3 CS Touring additionally offers customers a selection of comfort-enhancing features and driver assistance systems composed with the focus firmly on the enjoyment of unadulterated driving pleasure. Comfort Access, the alarm system, two-zone automatic climate control and the Harman Kardon Surround Sound System are all fitted as standard. Park Distance Control and the Parking Assistant, Front Collision Warning, Lane Departure Warning and the Speed Limit Info system are likewise standard, while the Driving Assistant system can be specified as an option.

+++ German trio Stephan Jäger, Martin Kaymer and Matti Schmid at 37th BMW International Open +++ Only DP World Tour tournament in Germany to take place from 1st to 5th July 2026 at Golfclub München Eichenried +++ Ten percent off general admissions and VIP tickets until 24th December 2025 +++ New after-work ticket available +++

Munich. The triad of world-class golf, sheer driving pleasure, and a dash of Bavarian zest in Germany since 1989 has been named the BMW International Open. The tournament has long been an institution on the DP World Tour; no other event has been collaborating with the same title partner without interruption for as long. The 37th edition of the BMW International Open will take place between 1st and 5th July 2026 (Golfclub München Eichenried). Three of Germany’s top players – Stephan Jäger, Matti Schmid and two-time Major winner Martin Kaymer – have already confirmed their participation, with further national and international stars set to follow. Tickets for what is currently the only German stop on the DP World Tour calendar are available from the official ticket shop, and you can take advantage of a ten percent Christmas discount until 24th December 2025: [EXTERNAL_RESOURCE]

The last time that Stephan Jäger teed off at his home club was in 2021. [ADDRESS]-year-old has been living in the USA with his family for many years and has made a name for himself on the PGA TOUR. Jäger had intended to return to the place where he grew up and learned to play golf to take part in this year’s BMW International Open. However, a joyous occasion in July 2025 prevented him from returning home as Jäger’s second son entered the world. Now there is nothing stopping him from competing next summer. The winner of the 2024 Texas Children's Houston Open said: “I’m really looking forward to finally playing at Eichenried again and enjoying the BMW International Open. Having a tournament like this in your hometown is a rare and lucky coincidence. I can’t wait to enjoy this week with my family as well as old friends and colleagues in front of a German crowd.”

Two-time Major winner Martin Kaymer is another golfer not wanting to miss out on this experience, and he enjoys a special connection with the BMW International Open. [ADDRESS]-year-old currently holds two tournament records: he is the only German winner and the youngest champion. Kaymer was 23 years and 177 days old when he won in Munich in 2008, but that is not the only reason that the event is one of his favourite tournaments. He said: “The people that you work alongside make a huge difference. You can tell that everyone at BMW is incredibly passionate about the tournament. Which makes it enjoyable for us as players, and I’m always grateful that we have a fantastic event like this here in Germany. Coming here is a source of great joy.”

It is this joy that Matti Schmid also associates with the BMW International Open. The Bavarian golfer, who predominantly plays on the PGA TOUR in the USA, has the iconic German tournament marked as a highlight on his calendar every year. As a child, the now 28-year-old watched the pros at Golfclub München Eichenried with great enthusiasm, and now the next generation of golfers are looking up to him: Schmid is currently the best-placed German golfer in the world rankings. At the 2025 BMW International Open he was the best home-grown player, finishing in joint seventh, and he cannot wait for the next edition: “The atmosphere was incredible throughout the week. I hope that everyone will be coming back because it’s great when we have a full house here.”

The Christmas promotional discount applies to day tickets and tournament tickets, as well as to Fairway Club tickets – excluding tickets that have already been discounted such as those for young people, students or people with disabilities. The ticket price includes a free shuttle bus service between Ismaning station and the golf club from Thursday to Sunday, and free car parking at the tournament site, subject to availability. There is no general admission fee for the Pro-Am tournament (Wednesday 1st July 2026). Children up to and including 14 years of age also enjoy free entry on all days.

New for the 2026 BMW International Open, an after-work ticket will be available for the Thursday or Friday. It will be valid as of 15:00 and can be purchased for half the cost of a day ticket. For information and prices, see the ticket shop at: [EXTERNAL_RESOURCE]

*New UK photography. With the first-ever BMW M3 CS Touring, BMW M GmbH adds another special-edition model to its high-performance vehicle line-up. This exclusive new derivative builds on the success of the BMW M3 Competition Touring with M xDrive, further enhancing its unique combination of exhilarating performance and exceptional practicality. Offering an increased engine power output, bespoke chassis tuning and minimised weight – helped by numerous components made from carbon fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP) – the new BMW M3 CS Touring (fuel consumption combined: 26.9 mpg; CO2 emissions combined: 240 g/km in the WLTP cycle, CO2 class: G) provides the necessary ingredients for a truly compelling driving experience. The six-cylinder in-line engine, delivering an impressive 550 hp, combined with an eight-speed M Steptronic transmission and M xDrive all-wheel drive, enables the BMW M3 CS Touring to sprint from 0 to 62 mph in just 3.5 seconds and reach a top speed of 186 mph.

*All figures relating to performance, consumption and emissions are provisional. All the stated technical data including fuel consumption, electric range and emissions figures relate to the offering in the German market. Dimensions and measurements refer to vehicles with basic configuration in Germany. These may vary depending on the wheel/tyre size and items of optional equipment selected. **Electronically limited. ***Price stated is the Recommended Retail Price which does not include On The Road costs and taxes.

Six-cylinder in-line engine infused with motorsport technology. Developed to deliver exceptional performance on track, the 3.0-litre six-cylinder in-line engine in the BMW M3 CS Touring features an extremely rigid crankcase with a sleeve-free, closed-deck construction, a forged lightweight crankshaft and a cylinder head with a 3D-printed core. The cylinder bores – which also contribute towards weight reduction – have a wire-arc sprayed iron coating to minimise frictional losses, while the cooling system and oil supply are designed to handle the sustained heavy loads generated during harder driving on a track. Upgraded M TwinTurbo technology ensures linear power delivery, raising the maximum charge pressure of the two mono-scroll turbochargers to 2.1 bar. Meanwhile, model-specific tweaks to the engine management system enable a maximum power output of 550 hp – a 20 hp increase over the current BMW M3 Competition Touring with M xDrive. A peak torque of 650 Nm is available from just 2,750 rpm and up to 5,950 rpm, with the engine developing its maximum output at 6,250 rpm before reaching a 7,200 rpm red line. A specially designed engine mounting with increased spring rates creates an extremely rigid connection between the power unit and the vehicle’s structure. This leads to a sharper engine response and an extremely direct transmission of power to the drivetrain. This instantaneous power delivery means the BMW M3 CS Touring can power from rest to 62 mph in 3.5 seconds, while 0 to 124 mph is achieved in 11.7 seconds. The mid-range sprint from 50 – 75 mph takes just 2.7 seconds in 4th gear and 3.5 seconds in 5th gear. The top speed of the special edition is 186 mph. Standard on the BMW M3 CS Touring is an M-specific exhaust system featuring electrically controlled flaps, a titanium rear silencer with weight-minimising design and – in customary M fashion – two pairs of tailpipes painted in matt Black. The engine’s acoustic presence varies according to the engine profile selected by the driver from the M Setup menu, with SPORT or SPORT+ mode producing a particularly aggressive soundstage, especially through gear changes and the accompanying adjustments in rev speed. Eight-speed M Steptronic transmission, M xDrive and Active M Differential for dynamic power transfer. The BMW M3 CS Touring features an eight-speed M Steptronic transmission with Drivelogic technology. A Drivelogic button is integrated into the gear selector, making it possible to alter the transmission’s shift characteristics with a choice of three settings. Alongside comfort-focused and sporty options, drivers can also engage a setting optimised specially for track driving. Both the gear selector and carbon-fibre shift paddles on the steering wheel enable sequential interventions during the gear selection process. Power is transferred to the road through the M xDrive all-wheel-drive system, which utilises an electronically controlled multi-plate clutch in the transfer case to ensure fully variable and super-smooth distribution of the engine’s power between the front and rear wheels. In tandem with the Active M Differential at the rear axle – where operation is also fully variable – the intelligent all-wheel-drive system’s rear-wheel bias enhances the M-typical handling dynamics. 4WD Sport mode can be selected via the M Setup menu to send an even greater proportion of the engine’s power to the rear wheels. Meanwhile, engaging 2WD mode delivers a driving experience for the ultimate purist, where all power is sent to the rear wheels and the DSC (Dynamic Stability Control) system is deactivated. Bespoke chassis tuning and outstanding stopping power. The BMW M3 CS Touring receives model-specific chassis tuning which accounts for its individual performance characteristics, profile and weight distribution. Similarly, settings for the DSC system and M Dynamic Mode are purposefully optimised for the specific demands of track driving. Also bespoke to this model are the electronically controlled adaptive M suspension dampers, M Servotronic steering and integrated braking system. M Compound brakes provide outstanding stopping power with callipers painted in a choice of Red or Black, while customers opting for M Carbon ceramic brakes can choose between Red or matt Gold. Forged M light-alloy wheels are standard fit and are available in an exclusive double-spoke design with a matt Gold Bronze or matt Black finish. [ADDRESS] inches in diameter at the front axle and 20 inches at the rear, the alloys are wrapped track tyres (275/35 ZR19 at the front, 285/30 ZR20 at the rear) as standard. Alternatively, customers can switch to sport tyres at no cost or specify ultra-track tyres from the options list. Exclusive carbon-fibre components and optimised body rigidity underpin outstanding performance. Intelligent lightweight construction plays a key role in achieving the individual performance characteristics of the BMW M3 CS Touring, with extensive use of carbon fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP) employed to minimise weight. CFRP components include the bonnet, front splitter, front air intakes, exterior mirror caps and rear diffuser. Moving inside, the M Carbon bucket seats and CFRP steering wheel shift paddles, interior trim strips and centre console also contribute towards weight reduction. These measures amount to a total weight saving of approximately 15 kilograms compared to the BMW M3 Competition Touring with M xDrive. Body rigidity is further increased by high-precision M front end strut braces – also engineered for lightness.

Spa-Francorchamps / Isle of Man. June began with a challenging but highly successful double-header for BMW Motorrad Motorsport. Round two of the FIM Endurance World Championship (FIM EWC) took place at Spa-Francorchamps (BEL), while the legendary Tourist Trophy was held on the Isle of Man. The results for the BMW M 1000 RR were second place overall in the FIM EWC for the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team, pole position and Superstock class victory for the Champion-MRP-Tecmas Team, a Superbike TT win for Davey Todd (GBR), and podium finishes for both Todd and Michael Dunlop (GBR) in the Superstock races on the Isle of Man.

FIM EWC at Spa-Francorchamps.

At the home race, the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team, led by Team Manager Werner Daemen (BEL) and with riders Markus Reiterberger (GER), Sylvain Guintoli (FRA), and Steven Odendaal (RSA), once again mastered extremely tricky conditions. Over the course of eight hours on the famously demanding ‘Ardennes rollercoaster’, the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps, heavy rain alternated with drying patches. Starting from third on the grid, the trio skillfully navigated the challenges aboard the #37 BMW M 1000 RR, supported by excellent pit work from the team. The reward was second place and the team’s first podium of the season, following a fourth-place finish at the Le Mans (FRA) season opener.

Ilya Mikhalchik (UKR), Kenny Foray (FRA), and David Checa (ESP) once again shared riding duties on the BMW M 1000 RR for the ERC Endurance #6 team, finishing sixth. LRP Poland’s #90 BMW M 1000 RR took 28th place overall and 15th in the EWC class.

In the Superstock category, the #9 BMW M 1000 RR was untouchable. The Champion-MRP-Tecmas Team, with riders Hannes Soomer (EST), Leandro Mercado (ARG), and Jan Bühn (GER), secured pole position on Friday and followed it up with a commanding victory on Saturday. Japanese outfit Team Étoile (#25 BMW M 1000 RR) started from third in class and just missed out on the podium with a fourth-place finish. The Hungarian Endurance Racing Team by Moto Jungle (#713 BMW M 1000 RR) finished 11th in the Superstock category. In the new Production class, team Flying Buffs M3 Racing took fourth place.

Round three of the 2025 FIM EWC, the eight-hour race at Suzuka, Japan, will be held on 3rd August.

Isle of Man Tourist Trophy.

The BMW M 1000 RR once again confirmed its top-tier status in road racing at this year’s Isle of Man TT. The first 1000cc race, the Superbike TT, was held on Monday and ended with a BMW one-two. Davey Todd (GBR) of the 8Ten Racing team added another TT victory to his collection. His closest rival and runner-up after four laps of the Mountain Course was Michael Dunlop (GBR / MD Racing). The two Superstock TT races followed on Tuesday and Friday, with more podiums for the BMW riders: Todd claimed second place in both races, while Dunlop finished third twice.

Anticipation was high for the event’s highlight, the prestigious Senior TT, scheduled to wrap up the event on Saturday. However, initial rain delays were followed by strong and shifting winds, and the organisers ultimately made the call to cancel the race on safety grounds.

Peter Hickman (GBR / 8Ten Racing) had also travelled to the Isle of Man as a top contender on the BMW M 1000 RR, but suffered a heavy crash during Friday’s qualifying. He sustained injuries and was treated at Nobles Hospital but returned to the paddock the next day to support teammate Todd at the races.

Sven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “Our riders, teams, and the BMW M 1000 RR faced some of the sport’s greatest challenges over the past few days – both in the FIM Endurance World Championship and at the Isle of Man – and they rose to the occasion brilliantly. At the [ADDRESS] Hours, they defied extremely difficult conditions, earning a fantastic second place for the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team and a Superstock win for Champion-MRP-Tecmas. The Isle of Man TT, the most demanding road race of all, also saw continued success for BMW – a superb one-two with Davey Todd and Michael Dunlop in the Superbike TT, followed by more podiums in the Superstock races. We were all eagerly awaiting the Senior TT, and while its cancellation due to high winds was disappointing, it was unquestionably the right decision. My thanks go to all the riders, teams, and the BMW Motorrad Motorsport crew who made these past days so successful. We also send our best wishes to Peter Hickman for a speedy recovery – we look forward to seeing Hicky back on his BMW M 1000 RR very soon!”

Christian Gonschor, Technical Director BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “As always, Spa was an incredibly intense event. This track often requires riding in wet conditions, and our riders had to perform at the highest level in both practice and the race. Notably, we set by far the fastest lap time in dry conditions, clearly demonstrating the potential of the BMW M 1000 RR. Our riders had great pace. Unfortunately, most of the race was wet with rapidly changing conditions. Tyre choices between slicks, intermediates, and wets were critical – and we always made the right call but in such a competitive field, finding the right pace remains extremely challenging. Congratulations to the winning Honda team – we’re very happy to have scored valuable points with second place. The Superstock victory for Champion-MRP-Tecmas was also a fantastic achievement. This was the first race for the team in this configuration, and though all are experienced, they had never formed a team before. In the Superstock class, the focus is on the base motorcycle, and it's fantastic that Jan Bühn, Tati Mercado, and our factory rider Hannes Soomer clinched the victory straight away with the BMW M 1000 RR. We also had strong results on the Isle of Man – a win and multiple podiums. Once again, the BMW M 1000 RR proved its strength. It’s a shame Peter Hickman was injured. He also had been showing great form until the crash. We wish him a speedy recovery.”

Markus Reiterberger, BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “It was a hard race, especially with these weather conditions, it was not so easy but my teammates and the team did an awesome job, and I also tried my best on and off the track. I think we know where we still can improve but we are happy. It’s our first podium with our new tyres, and we need them especially in these conditions. We are happy that we came through and with P2 we set a good base for our goals in the championship. Now we already fully focus on Suzuka. Thanks to the entire team; I am really delighted that we finished on the podium.”

Sylvain Guintoli, BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “At one point, it was really getting serious, there was a lot of water and aquaplaning, especially in the first section and on the back straight. I already said on Friday that it is going to be brutal and it was. We had all sorts of conditions. This second place is good and a strong result for us. We had a really strong pace in the dry, in the wet we were just missing something. Overall, it feels good to be back on the podium.”

Steven Odendaal, BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “It’s a solid result. It was easy to make mistakes in those conditions. I think about the championship and even if a second place is not a win we are getting there step by step. Two more to go, and then we will try to get it at the Bol d’Or!”

Hannes Soomer, Champion-MRP-Tecmas: “It was my first time at Spa, and it took me two runs to remember where the track goes as it is so long and quite difficult. After some ups and downs, including a crash for Leandro in qualifying, the race itself was really smooth. The entire team did a faultless job, every rider did three stints and we all were on the pace. The whole team did a fantastic job and that was rewarded with this great victory.”

Davey Todd, 8Ten Racing: “It has been a disappointing end to the TT this year. We finally got some nearly dry conditions but the wind was really bad which made it really hard out there. I am confident that the organisers made the right decision to cancel the Senior TT. That was the best thing to do for safety. We take the positives: I am the only Superbike winner at the TT this year and it makes me even more hungry to come back next year and win the Senior TT.”

# [ADDRESS].The Ultimate Driving Museum:The BMW CCA Foundation Brings History to Life in South Carolina
## From the outside, the building that houses the BMW Car Club of America Foundation is fairly undistinguished, as one would expect of a former pharmaceutical warehouse in Spartanburg, South Carolina. Inside, however, it’s a treasure trove of BMW ephemera, and the only museum outside Munich devoted exclusively to BMW.

From the outside, the building that houses the BMW Car Club of America Foundation is fairly undistinguished, as one would expect of a former pharmaceutical warehouse in Spartanburg, South Carolina. Inside, however, it’s a treasure trove of BMW ephemera, and the only museum outside Munich devoted exclusively to BMW. Dubbed “The Ultimate Driving Museum,” this humble space has been hosting truly spectacular exhibits since 2017, when guests were invited to explore a world-class collection of BMW race cars entitled Heroes of Bavaria .

To say the Foundation hit it out of the park with its first exhibit is no overstatement. Heroes of Bavaria featured a mind-blowing group of cars, from a 1939 328 sports racer to a Z4 GTLM raced by BMW Team RLL in the IMSA series in 2013 and 2014. In between, the exhibit included the first of two 700 RS Spyders raced by the BMW factory team in 1961 and ’62, the Miller & Norburn 2002 that carried Nick Craw to the 1973 IMSA BF Goodrich title, the only 3.0 CSL built as a rally car by BMW Motorsport, and the BMW [ADDRESS].0 CSL that won the 24 Hours of Daytona in 1976. Heroes also included a slate of M3 touring and GT racers, all with significant histories, plus BMW of North America’s trio of March-BMW prototypes from the 1980s, the factory IMSA [ADDRESS] M1, 1996 McLaren F1 GTR, and 1999 Williams-BMW V12 LMR. BMW’s open-wheel racers were represented by a 1981March-BMW F2, a 2003 Formula BMW, and a Williams-BMW FW22 raced in Formula One in 2000—to name just a few of the cars in the exhibit.

By the time Heroes of Bavaria opened, the BMW CCA Foundation was 15 years old, though its roots go back to 1991. That’s when Tammi Hull served as an instructor at a car control clinic hosted by the BMW CCA’s Golden Gate Chapter, of which she’d been president since 1990. “I saw how transformational it was for those kids,” Hull said. Four years later, she joined the club’s national board and suggested that it provide teen driver education nationwide via a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization.

A second dimension was added to the proposed foundation when longtime CCA member Dennis Ryan died, leaving behind a trove of memorabilia that his widow wanted to donate to the club. Hull suggested that the nonprofit could serve two missions: teen driving education and historical preservation. “[Executive director] Wynne Smith started planning to finally bring it to life in 1999,” Hull said. “Wynne was the driving force that made it happen.”

The BMW CCA Foundation was chartered in March 2002, and in 2003 it began hosting Street Survival teen driving clinics with major support from Tire Rack, BMW of North America, and Liberty Mutual Insurance. Street Survival teaches young people to control cars at the limit while improving their accident avoidance skills well beyond what they could learn from their parents or high school driver’s education programs. Headed by Bill Wade, Tire Rack Street Survival holds more than 100 schools each year, hosted nationwide by chapters of the BMW CCA, Porsche Club, and Sports Car Club of America. “I get emails on a weekly basis thanking me for running the program, from parents telling me it saved their kid’s life,” Wade says, noting that car accidents are a leading cause of death among young people.

The other half of the Foundation’s mission—and that which led to the creation of The Ultimate Driving Museum—involves preserving BMW’s rich history, which archivist Michael Mitchell has been doing since he became the Foundation’s first employee in 2002. Following the initial donation of Ryan’s memorabilia, the Foundation’s collection has become the largest repository of BMW-related items and documents in the US, and it’s accessible to the public in accordance with the Foundation’s non-profit mission.

In 2013, the Foundation moved into its permanent home in Greer, South Carolina, directly adjacent to the BMW Performance Center and just across the highway from BMW Manufacturing, where X-vehicles are assembled for worldwide consumption. A former pharmaceutical warehouse, the Foundation’s space has been transformed to house the archives and host exhibits. Those exhibits began with modest displays of cars owned by the Board of Trustees, then took a crucial step toward professionalism and historical interest when Heroes of Bavaria opened on [ADDRESS], 2017.

Heroes was the brainchild of the Foundation’s first executive director, Scott Dishman. Dishman had attended BMW’s 2016 centenary celebration at Laguna Seca and wanted to stage a similar display of BMW’s motorsport history.

“Our request to BMW of North America was this: You had an amazing exhibition of race cars at Laguna Seca, but most BMW enthusiasts on the East Coast never got to see it, and almost none of the 9,000 associates that work at BMW Manufacturing here in South Carolina got to see it,” Dishman said. “Let us recreate that, as best we can, and hold it for a while so that enthusiasts in this part of the country can make their way here over the course of the next three or four months and enjoy it.”

Thanks to cooperation from BMW NA’s Tom Plucinsky, the Foundation arranged to borrow nearly the entire race car collection owned by BMW Classic USA. “We were really happy to be able to do this,” Plucinsky said. “I’d much rather have these cars on display for people to see and appreciate rather than hidden in our warehouse. The only thing that could be better than having them at the Foundation would be having them on the track.”

Private owners—including Foundation trustees Peter Gleeson, Scott Hughes, and Lance White—loaned yet more race cars, and the result was a jaw-dropping collection that covered BMW’s entire motorsport history in the US…and beyond. Each car’s history was chronicled by Jackie Jouret, whose research was published in a beautifully-printed exhibit catalog illustrated with photography by Zach Suggs.

Heroes of Bavaria marked the start of an annual exhibition-and-book series at the BMW CCA Foundation. It was followed in 2018 by “ The ICON” , a celebration of the 2002’s 50th birthday that included every 2002 variant produced by BMW, as well as a fine selection of modified cars. Adding to The Icon’s visual appeal, the 2002s on display encompassed the range of colors in which the model was offered, from the sedate beiges of the early 1600-2s to the jewel tones and florescent “safety colors” of the 1970s models.

For its third exhibit in 2019, the Foundation celebrated a half-century of the BMW Car Club of America with “ PASSION: 50 Years of BMW Cars and Community” . That exhibit featured 22 BMWs that had inspired particular passion among enthusiasts, each owned by a dedicated club member of long standing.

PASSION was followed by an even more spectacular exhibit, entitled “ GENESIS: BMW from the Beginning” . GENESIS covered BMW’s history from its origins as a manufacturer of airplane engines from 1916, through its addition of motorcycles in 1923 and automobiles in 1928. It included a trio of significant motorcycles, including a 1927 R47 sport bike and a 1931 R2 single, as well as a number of pre-war and early postwar automobiles, beginning with a 1930 3/15 HP DA2 believed to be the oldest BMW in the US.

BMW didn’t begin exporting cars directly to the US until 1954, and then only in limited volume until the 1600-2 became a surprise hit in 1967. Its earlier cars are rare in this country, yet GENESIS assembled a comprehensive selection of automobiles that told the full story of BMW’s prewar success and postwar reconstruction. The cars and motorcycles were loaned to the Foundation by US collectors including Dirk de Groen, Manny Carter, Manfred Scharmach, Rick Meinig, and Karra Cannum, to name but a few. Nearly all had significant histories: Meinig’s 327/28 convertible, for example, was originally owned by Schorsch Meier, a factory BMW motorcycle racer who won the 1939 Isle of Man TT as well as numerous championships. Two postwar BMWs built at Eisenach revealed Germany’s Cold War cleavage into two states, giving attendees a rare look at these BMWs built under Soviet domination. Others had more personal histories, like the 1960 3.2 Super sedan that Alf Gebhardt inherited from his father, its original owner.

Alas, few were able to see GENESIS in person, as the Covid pandemic forced the closure of public spaces like The Ultimate Driving Museum shortly before the exhibit was set to open in May 2020. While the exhibit’s opening was on hold, the Foundation released a video by David Rose that highlighted the beautiful BMWs waiting to welcome guests when the doors finally opened that fall.

“Doing the virtual video opening was important,” said trustee Bruce Hazard, explaining that the museum wasn’t the only Foundation activity affected by the pandemic. “We kept the museum open as much as possible given the city, county, and state restrictions, and we didn’t give up! But we were forced to close down Street Survival temporarily, because we couldn’t expose students or instructors in the closed environment of the car.”

With the worst effects of the pandemic in the rear-view mirror, and following Dishman’s departure at the end of 2019, the Foundation carried on with a mini-exhibit on the history of the Z-cars produced across the street by BMW Manufacturing, and full exhibits celebrating the 50th anniversary of BMW Motorsport in 2022, and the 100th anniversary of BMW motorcycles in 2023. Last year, the museum took a comprehensive look at MINI, exhibiting a range of pre-BMW Minis from the 1960s to the highly personalized MINIs of the current era under BMW’s ownership of the marque. In 2025, the Foundation is celebrating ALPINA with a similarly thorough exhibit. As always, opening and closing events give attendees an opportunity to mingle with the cars’ owners as well as Foundation trustees and BMW NA executives.

The BMW CCA Foundation has helped turn Greer, South Carolina into the epicenter of BMW enthusiasm in the US, especially given its proximity to BMW Manufacturing and the BMW Performance Center. (The headquarters of the BMW Car Club of America and Motorcycle Owner’s Association are nearby, as well.) The Foundation benefits further from a close working relationship with BMW of North America and MINI USA, both of which support the organization’s efforts to preserve company history. Crucially, BMW Classic USA has raised money for the Foundation by offering rides in its fleet of vintage race cars at the Performance Center and other tracks.

“We at BMW NA are very fortunately to have passionate club and foundation organizations that love our products and enjoy sharing our history. Our job at BMW NA is to help both the club and the foundation thrive. Over the years, as the company has grown, we have come to rely on the BMW CCA Foundation to preserve our archival materials and display elements. It is a synergy that works very well for the company and the club members”. Added Plucinsky.

Equally important, the Foundation has strong ties to the BMW collector community throughout the US. Its board of trustees includes a number of past presidents and national officers of the BMW CCA and many of the country’s most prominent collectors, ensuring that the Foundation has a firm connection to the car club at large as well as strong sources of expertise and support.

“Many of the trustees have given decades of service to the club, devoting a ton of time and energy to making these ideas come to life,” Wensberg says. “The club has a lot to be proud of in terms of what the Foundation has accomplished.”

+++ BMW Group and partners provide access to tennis for youths from schools in Munich through FUTURE ACES +++ Youths participate in a school holiday camp at MTTC Iphitos +++ BMW Open by Bitpanda in April marked the launch of the initiative +++

Munich. Club sports and tennis are effective platforms for young people - not only for physical activity but also for personal development and as a gateway to social connections and networks. The goal of FUTURE ACES is to open the door to these valuable future opportunities for as many young people as possible. As part of the initiative, 19 students from schools in Munich participated in a tennis camp at MTTC Iphitos during the Pentecost holidays. FUTURE ACES is a joint project by the BMW Group, MMP Event, the Iphitos Tennis Club, and other partners of the ATP 500 tennis tournament BMW Open by Bitpanda.

Boys and girls had the chance to apply through the organisations "DEIN MÜNCHEN" and the "Kick ins Leben" foundation, with which the BMW Group has been closely collaborating for many years. Nineteen students received four days of intensive tennis training sessions. Guided by coaches from MTTC Iphitos, they practiced basic strokes and techniques while training alongside other participants of the tennis camp. Sportswear, shoes, and rackets were provided by the partners and tennis equipment supplier Dunlop.

Through FUTURE ACES, the partners not only make tennis accessible to young people with challenging starts, but also enable them to develop personally in a supportive environment, build connections, and gain valuable experiences. This created a week full of joy for the children and teenagers during the training sessions.

The long-term FUTURE ACES programme was launched at the BMW Open by Bitpanda in April. For every ace served during the ATP 500 tournament in Munich, the three partners donated a coaching session for students and young people facing barriers to success. A total of 361 aces were served by the professionals, including German singles champion Alexander Zverev, during the tournament, resulting in 361 coaching sessions. The Pentecost camp was the first measure of the joint initiative, with more to follow - both on and off the court. The goal is to offer participants a variety of opportunities, such as information days and internships within the club and the BMW Open environment, to help them discover their potential and develop their skills - empowering them to embark on a self-determined life as FUTURE ACES.

Sebring. The 73rd edition of the Twelve Hours of Sebring (USA) this coming Saturday, 15th March, is all about a significant anniversary. BMW North America celebrates its 50th anniversary this year, and the endurance classic in Florida plays a special role in this history. The story of BMW North America began in 1975 with the victory of the BMW 3.0 CSL at Sebring. Accordingly, the two BMW M Hybrid V8s of BMW M Team RLL will compete from this season’s second race of the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship (IWSC) with a special anniversary livery.

1975 was a historic year for BMW in North America. BMW North America was founded on 15th March, and just days later, the BMW 3.0 CSL secured the brand’s first major sports car victory in the USA at Sebring. This triumph came in the very first race that BMW Motorsport GmbH and the newly established BMW North America entered together. [ADDRESS] years later, the BMW M Hybrid V8 livery at the Twelve Hours of Sebring pays tribute to half a century of motorsport success in North America. It showcases key milestones from 1975 to today, embedded within the track silhouette of Sebring. As witnesses of history, Jochen Neerpasch, co-founder and first managing director of BMW Motorsport GmbH, and Brian Redman (USA), Sebring winner of 1975, will be present for the anniversary. The BMW M Hybrid V8s will continue to feature these special liveries throughout the IWSC season.

The Twelve Hours of Sebring marks the second event of the 2025 IWSC season. At the endurance classic in Florida, BMW M Motorsport teams aim to extend the 50-year legacy of success. BMW M Team RLL fought for an overall podium finish with its two BMW M Hybrid V8s in the GTP class at the season opener at Daytona (USA) in January. In the GTD-PRO class, Paul Miller Racing, with two BMW M4 GT3 EVOs, is among the favorites, while Turner Motorsport is targeting victory in the GTD class with the BMW M4 GT3 EVO.

[ADDRESS]-hour race at Sebring starts on Saturday, 15th March, at 10:10 local time (15:10 PM CET) and can be watched live at www.imsa.tv .

Andreas Roos, Head of BMW M Motorsport: “Sebring and BMW M Motorsport share a very special bond. This track has played an outstanding role in our history in North America, which now spans half a century. We are excited for the anniversary weekend, and our goal is to add new milestones to those already displayed on the liveries of our BMW M Hybrid V8s. We have already shown at Daytona and at the FIA WEC season opener in Qatar that we have made another significant step forward with our LMDh car. This gives us confidence for a strong performance in the GTP class. Our new BMW M4 GT3 EVO has also immediately demonstrated its winning potential. [ADDRESS] years of BMW of North America with the corresponding results would be fantastic.”

Laguna Seca. The impressive streak in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship (IWSC) continued at Laguna Seca (USA). Dries Vanthoor (BEL) in the BMW M Team RLL #24 BMW M Hybrid V8 once again was the fastest man in qualifying. He claimed his and teammate Philipp Eng’s (AUT) fourth pole position in as many races this season. In the race itself, the #24 car battled for victory right up to the end and secured third place after a dramatic finish. This marks the second podium of the IMSA season for Vanthoor/Eng, following their result at Long Beach (USA). In the #25 BMW M Hybrid V8, Marco Wittmann (GER) and Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) also delivered a strong performance, taking fourth place – their best result of the season so far.

At the start of the two-hour and 40-minute race, Vanthoor maintained the lead and held a several-second advantage over the field for the first 50 minutes. Only when lapped traffic began to factor in were the chasing cars able to close the gap, kicking off a tight battle for the top three. After a late first pit stop, Eng rejoined the race in third place with car #24. Both he and later Vanthoor managed to stay close to the leading two Porsches. In a tense and uninterrupted final phase without any full course yellows to neutralise the field, the outcome remained wide open. Vanthoor was only a few tenths of a second behind in third place, waiting for his opportunity to attack. In a dramatic fight for the win, he was touched in the final corner and spun off the track. Nonetheless, Vanthoor was able to get the #24 car going again and cross the finish line in third.

In the sister car #25, van der Linde and Wittmann also confirmed the competitiveness of the BMW M Hybrid V8. Starting from sixth on the grid, they pursued an alternate strategy and made an early first pit stop, which initially dropped them further down the field. However, after around 90 minutes of racing, Wittmann climbed from seventh to fourth within just a few laps. The #25 ultimately crossed the line right behind its sibling car, rounding off a strong showing for BMW M Team RLL with fourth place.

The BMW M4 GT3 EVO crews faced a tough race at Laguna Seca. In the GTD-Pro class, Dan Harper (GBR) and Max Hesse (GER) took fifth place in the #48 car from Paul Miller Racing. Their teammates Madison Snow and Neil Verhagen (both USA) were tenth in the #1 car. In the GTD class, the #96 BMW M4 GT3 EVO from Turner Motorsport, driven by Robby Foley and Patrick Gallagher (both USA), finished ninth.

Comments after the race:

Andreas Roos, Head of BMW M Motorsport: “The race weekend at Laguna Seca confirmed that we’ve continued to close the gap and are now fighting for top positions with the performance of our BMW M Hybrid V8. Dries Vanthoor taking the fourth consecutive pole position was sensational. Sheldon van der Linde in car #25 was also quick and secured sixth place in a very tight qualifying session. Both cars delivered a strong performance in the race as well. In a race shaped in part by strategy, the team and drivers executed a flawless collective effort. It was extremely intense right up to the final corner, and we were fighting for the win. In the end, Dries Vanthoor and Philipp Eng secured their second consecutive podium, and Sheldon van der Linde and Marco Wittmann achieved their best result of the season so far with fourth place, finishing right behind. The trend is clearly upward, and now we’ll continue working hard to take that final step and reward everyone’s hard work with a victory.”

Dries Vanthoor (#24 BMW M Hybrid V8, BMW M Team RLL, 3rd place): “I think P3 was almost the maximum we could have achieved today. The Porsches were again strong but we had a good race, the team did a great job. We did the best we could. That I was pushed off in the last corner was unfortunate. It was a racing incident, even though I think it was unnecessary. We still have work to do but having had two podiums in two races is a very nice achievement, but we just want more after the qualifying achievements and win a race.”

Philipp Eng (#24 BMW M Hybrid V8, BMW M Team RLL, 3rd place): “It was a very exciting race and a very good weekend overall. Qualifying again was great from Dries and the entire team. The race was tricky but good fun. P3 is another good result but of course we wanted to get the victory. We had the pace and the package but in the end it didn’t quite work out. We will just work harder from here. Thanks to the whole team.”

Marco Wittmann (#25 BMW M Hybrid V8, BMW M Team RLL, 4th place): “It was a difficult weekend for us, we had some issues in FP2 and qualifying. We tried to fix them for the race but went a bit blind into the race. Nevertheless we made some good progress, gained a couple of positions, had some good fights and good fun out there. Obviously the aim was to step on the podium which was not in our reach here though. We were lacking the pace a bit which we have to investigate. Still we can be fairly happy with how the race went and with P4 considering how the weekend went. Now we need to look into the data and find some performance for the next races. Then the aim is to bring both cars on the podium and ideally chase the win.”

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Debrecen. With an impressive ceremony that artistically combined Hungarian culture and modern automotive production, [EXECUTIVE_OFFICER], Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG, today officially opened the BMW Group plant in Debrecen. The BMW Group’s newest and most innovative production site marks the beginning of a new era for the company. In late October, the new BMW iX3 will enter series production in the Hungarian university town of Debrecen as the first vehicle of the Neue Klasse. Plant Debrecen was planned virtually and realised in practice fully in line with the principles of the BMW iFACTORY, becoming the first BMW Group car plant to rely entirely on electricity from renewable energy during normal operation.

In addition to [EXECUTIVE_OFFICER], high-ranking representatives from Hungarian politics, such as Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and the Mayor of Debrecen, László Papp, as well as Milan Nedeljković, Member of the Board of Management for Production, [EXECUTIVE_OFFICER], Member of the Board of Management for Human Resources and Real Estate, and Hans-Peter Kemser, President and CEO BMW Manufacturing Hungary Kft., attended the grand opening.

“In our global production network, our new plant in Debrecen is a pioneer: It is our first fully-electric plant, the first production site to operate entirely without fossil fuels – and the first to build vehicles for the Neue Klasse. This makes our plant in Debrecen a decisive factor in the BMW Group's future success,” said [EXECUTIVE_OFFICER]. “The opening also sends a strong signal: We are expanding our footprint on our home continent and reaffirming our commitment to Europe as a strong and competitive location for industry.”

Hans-Peter Kemser added at the ceremony: “This is not only a new BMW Group plant – it is a cornerstone of progress. We are a partner to culture, to education and to the University of Debrecen, where together we foster the talents that will shape the future. And above all, it is a community – deeply embedded in the life of Debrecen and Hungary.”

Strengthening the industrial base and expanding training

The official opening ceremony began with a look back at the plant’s construction, following a 2018 decision that launched one of Hungary’s largest greenfield investments. The BMW Group’s first Central European location has firmly placed Debrecen on the region's automotive map, creating more than 2,000 direct jobs – and many more along the supply chain, at regional suppliers and service providers that have recently established themselves in Debrecen, alongside national and international companies. The new plant has also strengthened the industrial park and driven additional investment in transport and infrastructure.

At the same time, through collaborations with institutions such as the local university and the Vocational Training Centre of Debrecen, DSZC, Plant Debrecen has also become one of the largest training hubs for dual education programmes in Hungary.

Only the best of the best for Debrecen

Plant Debrecen is the first BMW Group production site not tied to a specific primary plant. Instead, it serves as a network plant, combining best practices from different locations worldwide. For example, the press shop is modelled on the systems used in Spartanburg (USA) and Swindon (Great Britain), with their know-how and technologies further refined for Debrecen. In the body shop, the positioning of nearly 1,000 industrial robots, along with their processes, was digitally simulated in detail beforehand. The number of joining methods was also significantly reduced, with further streamlining allowing design features for the Neue Klasse to be integrated early in development.

Paint shop key to largest reduction in CO 2 e emissions

At BMW Group Plant Debrecen, the paint shop plays a critical role in significantly reducing the BMW iX3’s CO 2 e footprint. Production of the new BMW iX3 will generate a total of about 80kg CO₂e (scope 1/2 emissions). This figure covers CO₂e emissions from Plant Debrecen, as well as in-house parts production at other BMW Group facilities, including components manufactured in Landshut, for example. This represents a reduction of approx. two-thirds compared to production of existing BMW derivatives. For Plant Debrecen alone, this approach will reduce CO₂e emissions from the manufacture of a vehicle, including its high-voltage battery, by around 90% – to about 34 kg CO₂e (when operating at full capacity, compared with other BMW Group facilities).

About a quarter of the plant's annual power needs will be supplied by the 50‑hectare on-site photovoltaic system, one of the largest in Hungary. Surplus solar energy, such as that generated on non-working days, is stored in a 1,800 m³ thermal storage system with a capacity of 130 MWh.

Digitalised assembly processes and smart “finger structure”

Complete digitalisation of production processes further boosts assembly efficiency – for example, sensors and camera systems along the production line are used to automate quality processes. AI evaluates the data and provides real-time feedback to employees on the assembly line. The building's “finger structure” – an optimised version of BMW Group Plant Leipzig – allows 80% of parts to be delivered directly to the correct point of assembly on the line. In-house logistics are fully electric.

High-voltage battery assembly in line with “local for local” principle

High-voltage batteries are assembled directly on site, allowing for short distances in line with the “local for local” principle. Plant Debrecen will be the first of five plants worldwide to begin series production of Gen6 high-voltage batteries at this location. Seamless in-line quality inspections and 100% end‑of‑line monitoring enable a consistent zero-defect approach.

Final photo with employees and two BMW iX3s

The opening ceremony concluded with a music and dance performance celebrating Hungarian culture and traditions, which the BMW Group also supports through local events and organisations. To wrap up, numerous employees joined Viktor Orbán and [EXECUTIVE_OFFICER] on stage, alongside two new BMW iX3s.

+++ Team Europe defends the Ryder Cup with an 15-13 away victory +++ Record lead for the Europeans after two days +++ USA narrowly misses historic comeback +++ Luke Donald (ENG) remains unbeaten as both player and captain +++ Worldwide Partner BMW delivers fan experiences, a large shuttle fleet, and exclusive live broadcasts in BMW vehicles +++

New York/Munich. The 45th Ryder Cup on the Black Course at Bethpage State Park near New York will be remembered for a long time. Since 1927, the enthralling team duel between the best golfers from the USA and Europe has written countless legendary stories. With their 15-13 victory on foreign soil, the defending champions added another stunning chapter. On Saturday, the Europeans achieved the largest lead (11.5-4.5) any team has held after two days since Europe began competing against the USA in 1979. In Sunday’s singles matches, the Americans nearly overturned what seemed like an insurmountable deficit, before Shane Lowry (IRL) delivered the decisive half-point on the way to the fifth away victory for Team Europe since 1979.

Captain Luke Donald (ENG) continued to maintain his flawless Ryder Cup record. As a player, the former world number one won the Ryder Cup trophy in all four of his appearances (2004, 2006, 2010, and 2012). Now, as a captain, he has two triumphs to his name. Two years ago, Donald also led Team Europe to victory. Just as in Rome, Team Europe impressed in the heated atmosphere of Bethpage Black with a consistently strong team performance, hitting the ground running from the very start. The Europeans won all four foursome sessions on Friday and Saturday – a remarkable first as no team had ever even claimed the first three sessions before.

Just when everything seemed to point to a landslide victory for the visitors, the tide turned dramatically on Sunday. The U.S. team took the lead in one singles match after another, and a sporting miracle suddenly seemed within reach. By the end of Sunday, Europe would win only a single match (Ludvig Åberg, SWE, against Patrick Cantlay) but still manage to hold on to their lead. It was Shane Lowry who ultimately secured the throphy by winning the 18th hole in his match against Russell Henley, earning the crucial half-point that brought the European team to 14 points – enough to retain the trophy as defending champions.

One of the most spectacular holes on Bethpage Black is the 14th, a short par 3 where numerous breathtaking shots and decisive moments unfolded over the last three days. BMW customers and guests had the privilege of witnessing this up close from the BMW House, which featured its own grandstand directly behind the tee. The 14th tee also served as the perfect stage for the new BMW iX3, the first series-produced Neue Klasse model. The new-generation BMW iX3 is a fully electric Sports Activity Vehicle that gives customers their first on-the-road taste of a whole new era of Sheer Driving Pleasure.

BMW supported the smooth execution of the 45th Ryder Cup with a fleet of over 200 vehicles, ensuring safe transportation for members of the golf and event teams as well as BMW guests to and from the venue. Like BMW customers in many countries, they enjoyed the exclusive opportunity to follow the Ryder Cup live from inside their vehicles.

# BMW Group scores circular economy win with high-voltage batteries
## +++ Long-term partnership with SK tes +++ High-voltage batteries to be recycled, with the reclaimed secondary raw materials fed back into the value chain +++ Closed loop for cobalt, nickel and lithium +++ Global rollout on cards +++

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Munich. With electric mobility continuing to gather pace, recycling high-voltage batteries is increasingly under the spotlight. After successfully launching a closed-loop recycling system for the reuse of raw materials from high-voltage batteries thanks to the BMW Brilliance Automotive Joint Venture (BBA) in China in 2022, the BMW Group has now hit another milestone on its journey. [ADDRESS] November 2024, it launched a pan-European partnership with SK tes, a leading provider of innovative technology lifecycle solutions. The special recycling process recovers cobalt, nickel and lithium from used batteries before returning them to the value chain to make new batteries. This closed-loop system is set to expand to the US-Mexico-Canada region as early as 2026. Its long-term partnership with SK tes sees the BMW Group directly involved in the practical recycling processes, allowing it to feed back valuable insights to the development departments. Moving forward, high-voltage batteries from BMW Group development, production and markets in Europe that are no longer fit for use are to be delivered to SK tes in what is the first step towards an effective and sustainable circular economy for batteries. SK tes then converts the old batteries into high-quality metals that can be reintroduced to battery production. The latter process sees the batteries mechanically shredded, during which the metals are concentrated to leave a material called black mass. The valuable materials, namely nickel, lithium and cobalt, are then recovered in a highly effective chemical process called hydrometallurgy. Among other things, these secondary raw materials will be used for the new GEN 6 drive train. "Partnerships like this increase our efficiency in terms of the circular economy. In the closed-loop process, all partners mutually benefit from their experiences," says Jörg Lederbauer, Vice President Circular Economy, Spare Parts Supply High Voltage Battery and Electric Powertrain at BMW AG. The battery recycling process of SK tes has won numerous sustainability and innovation awards worldwide – from the Business Intelligence Group’s Sustainability Service of the Year to the UN Global Compact’s Apex Award.

# BMW NA 50th Anniversary | 50 Stories for 50 Years [ADDRESS]: “Formula-BMW USA: For the Future of Racing
## To compete successfully at the top levels of motorsport, you need more than well-developed machinery. You also need well-developed drivers. When BMW re-entered Formula One in 2000, its need for young talent became acute. Having focused on production-based racing since ending its partnership with Brabham in 1986, BMW Motorsport had no real pipeline for drivers in open-wheel formulae. Although the company had been supplying engines to Germany’s highly-regarded Formula BMW ADAC (Allgemeiner Deutscher Automobil Club) junior series since 1991, it needed a more comprehensive involvement to achieve its driver-development goals.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To compete successfully at the top levels of motorsport, you need more than well-developed machinery. You also need well-developed drivers. When BMW re-entered Formula One in 2000, its need for young talent became acute. Having focused on production-based racing since ending its partnership with Brabham in 1986, BMW Motorsport had no real pipeline for drivers in open-wheel formulae. Although the company had been supplying engines to Germany’s highly-regarded Formula BMW ADAC ( Allgemeiner Deutscher Automobil Club ) junior series since 1991, it needed a more comprehensive involvement to achieve its driver-development goals.

In 2001, BMW Motorsport moved to do exactly that. Taking over the ADAC series altogether, BMW would provide not just engines but complete cars. At the same time, BMW created a unique organizational structure designed to help young drivers—age 15 years or older, with no prior international racing experience other than karting—build professional careers through its education and coaching program located at two Formula BMW Racing Centers in Valencia, Spain, and Bahrain. The new Formula BMW series began running in 2002, with races in Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium. Its first champion, Nico Rosberg, won the title as a rookie; he’d make it to Formula One in 2006, and he became F1 world champion ten years later. In 2003, F-BMW added a series in Asia, and Ho-Pin Tung was crowned champion; he’d become a test driver for BMW Williams and BMW Sauber F1.

Shortly after the 2003 season got underway, BMW Motorsport Director Dr. Mario Theissen decided that the series should expand to the UK and North America for 2004. BMW of North America VP of Marketing Jim McDowell agreed, and preparations began for the debut of Formula BMW USA the following year.

McDowell tapped Alex Schmuck to organize the series, a formidable responsibility for a young marketing manager. “It was a big lift, but Schmuck had a passion for motorsports, and incredible amounts of experience in karting,” said Tom Salkowsky, then BMW NA’s team leader for Experiential Marketing.

Schmuck announced the series at the Long Beach Grand Prix on [ADDRESS], 2003, hoping to entice ChampCar teams to fund a junior program in Formula BMW USA for the following season. “We had a very short lead time, and we didn’t have a sanctioning body or a schedule when we went out to sell cars,” Schmuck said. “I said, ‘Listen, we’re racing in F1, we’re dedicated to motorsports, and we want to do this in the US,’ but it was a tough sell.”

Schmuck’s task was made challenging by Formula BMW’s high cost of entry compared to other junior series. The price of a car was set at $64,000, plus $20,000 for spare parts and $20,000 per entry for the season. With travel and other expenses, a full season of racing could cost up to $200,000—a hefty sum for a driver age 15 to 23.

The cars themselves were certainly worth the money, being far more sophisticated than the steel tube-framed cars most youngsters would drive after moving up from karting. Penned by Michael Scully at BMW Designworks/USA in California, the F-BMW race cars were manufactured by Mygale in France. With a safe and strong carbon-Kevlar composite tubs, the BMW Motorsport-developed Formula Rescue Seat, and accommodation for a HANS device, each F-BMW exceeded FIA safety requirements for the class.

Power for the 1,003-pound race car was supplied by a 1,171cc K 1200 RS four-cylinder BMW motorcycle engine, mounted behind the driver and delivering 140 horsepower and 86 pound-feet through a single-plate clutch and a Hewland six-speed sequential gearbox. The double-wishbone suspension had adjustable dampers at all four corners; brake bias and aerodynamic downforce were also adjustable, with assistance from Pi Systems’ onboard data recording.

Schmuck and his Formula BMW USA Team worked the phones, reaching out to teams in the US and Canada. Among the first to say yes were [ADDRESS] winner Bobby Rahal, who created the one-car Vitesse team for his son Graham, and Tom Milner, whose Prototype Technology Group ran BMW’s M3 program in the American Le Mans Series. Milner agreed to field a team of four cars, one of which would be driven by his son, Tommy Junior.

“That really showed the North American market that if people like Rahal and Milner are going to participate, this is a series that will come to fruition,” Schmuck said. Indeed it did. While enlisting teams to participate, Schmuck negotiated a sanctioning deal with Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART), then North America’s premier open-wheel racing series. [ADDRESS] races over seven weekends in 2004, Formula BMW would race in support of three CART races, the F1 Grands Prix of Canada and the US, and two American Le Mans Series races.

“That was by design,” Schmuck said. “CART gave us a fantastic deal, which allowed us to get in front of three audiences. BMW was competing with the M3 in ALMS, and we had access to Formula One races in the US and Canada. That made it much more appealing for teams to participate.”

As the start of the season drew closer, Schmuck still hadn’t secured enough cars to complete the grid. On McDowell’s suggestion, he called BMW dealers and racing team owners Roger Penske and Rick Hendrick, both of whom declined to participate but agreed to buy a car that BMW could provide to a promising young driver. That would be especially helpful for drivers of limited resources, as would winning one of the six $40,000 scholarships awarded by BMW Motorsport following the pre-season licensing school in Valencia. In its first year, Formula BMW USA provided scholarships to Trevor Daley, Billy Johnson, Graham Rahal, James Hinchcliffe, Tommy Milner, and Jonathan Summerton, none of whom were older than 17. When the season started at Lime Rock on [ADDRESS], 2004, Schmuck and his Formula BMW USA team had persuaded seven teams to enter 16 cars, and an eighth joined later in the season with two more cars. Both races were won by Andreas Wirth, a 20-year-old German who’d finished ninth in F-BMW Europe in 2002 and tenth in 2003. Wirth would win two more races and the first F-BMW USA title, beating Rookie Cup winner Hinchcliffe and Summerton to the $20,000 prize.

More teams joined for the second season, and as many as two dozen cars comprised the grids for support races at the Canadian and US Grands Prix. France’s Richard Philippe took the 2005 title, followed by Canadians Robert Wickens in 2006 and Daniel Morad in 2007, American Alexander Rossi in 2008, and Colombian Gabby Chaves in 2009. From 2005 to 2009, those winners and their closest competitors would face off against their counterparts from the other F-BMW series at the Formula BMW World Final, the winner awarded a test in one of BMW’s Formula One cars.

In its final two seasons, Formula BMW USA was renamed Formula BMW Americas following the addition of a race weekend in Mexico. Only eleven drivers competed in all twelve races of 2009, none of which ran in support of F1. The global financial crisis that had begun in 2008 was still affecting new-car sales, and the entire industry was tightening its belt. At the end of 2009, BMW Motorsport withdrew from Formula One, pulling the plug on Formula BMW, as well.

The series may have ended in 2009, but its legacy continues to be felt throughout motorsport. Formula BMW was far more than simply a step up from karting, and it offered far more than just track time and competition.

“Formula BMW offered young drivers an education, which other series didn’t,” Schmuck said. “We offered them a coach for physical fitness—Jim Leo, who does a lot of work with IndyCar drivers—and advice about nutrition. We gave them PR training with Bill Cobb, doing on-camera interviews and asking them to prepare a presentation on approaching sponsors. We also gave them access to our factory drivers, to hear how they’d progressed through their careers, and access to Mario Theissen, so they could hear from an F1 boss what’s important to him as a team manager, and what he looks for in a driver. That’s access that no other race series had, and no other race series had a direct path into an F1 test session.”

Beyond access, Formula BMW USA provided competitors with structure. “In typical BMW fashion, we had thought out the details from the layout of the paddock to the protocol from when the drivers and teams arrived at the track to when they left the circuit,” Salkowsky said.

The professional-level paddock included a hospitality tent that hosted media events, and where drivers and their families could socialize, eat, and entertain sponsors. “It really set a new benchmark in terms of what a junior race series could provide, and it provided a real sense of community,” Schmuck said.

The series honed young drivers’ communication skills, not only with sponsors but with engineers. Thanks to the adjustability of the F-BMW car’s suspension, gearbox, and aerodynamics, Schmuck said, “The driver had to work with the team to set the car up every weekend, to get the highest performance for the track, the weather, etc.”

That in itself tended to separate those who’d been fast in non-adjustable karts from those with the technical and analytical skills needed in professional car racing. As a result, those who did well in Formula BMW often went on to long careers as professional drivers.

“For me, the greatest thing was being able to see how we were able to indirectly affect or make possible careers in motorsports through this program,” Schmuck said. “James Hinchcliffe, Graham Rahal, Billy Johnson… Tommy Milner might not have become a professional driver without this program, but he had the talent, worked hard, and became a successful sports car driver, winning the 24 Hours of Daytona and the 24 Hours of Le Mans twice. Robert Wickens won the series in his second year, and became a global Red Bull driver and went on to drive in DTM and in the IndyCar Series. Alexander Rossi went on to win the [ADDRESS] after starting in Formula BMW USA.”

Other F-BMW USA graduates include Esteban Gutiérrez, who raced in F1 with Haas, and IndyCar driver Simona de Silvestro. Worldwide, F-BMW alumni include F1 world champions Sebastian Vettel and the aforementioned Nico Rosberg, plus current and former F1 drivers Ralf Schumacher, Sebastian Buemi, Timo Glock, Nico Hulkenberg, Sergio Pérez, Daniil Kvyat, Marcus Ericsson, Daniel Ricciardo, Carlos Sainz Jr., and many more who’ve competed successfully in other professional series.

Formula BMW USA had a positive effect on BMW of North America, too. It cemented BMW’s place in North American motorsport, and it communicated BMW’s brand values to motorsport enthusiasts.

“I think it made a connection, created a vertical structure in which the base is BMW,” said Salkowsky, “We’re a brand for drivers, we have these wonderful street cars, which extend to racing with the M3 and elevate to the pinnacle of motorsport in F1. And Formula BMW gave us the ability to communicate that not only do we do this at the highest level, but at the entry level. Who but BMW could do this?”

# DTM: Bitter end for René Rast in the title showdown at Hockenheim – Marco Wittmann on the podium.
## +++ René Rast goes for his fourth title in the final race of the DTM season but is forced to retire after a collision +++ Rast announces his retirement from DTM after 138 races, three titles, 31 victories, and 26 pole positions +++ Sensational comeback: Marco Wittmann secures a podium finish as second in a dramatic finale during the Sunday race +++ ADAC GT Masters: FK Performance Motorsport in second place +++

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hockenheim. The dream of a fourth DTM drivers' title for René Rast (GER) has been shattered. In the final race of the season at the Hockenheimring (GER), the 38-year-old had excellent chances in the showdown for the championship after a strong start, running in second place. However, a collision in the first lap ended all his hopes. On Friday, ahead of the race weekend, Rast had announced his provisional retirement from DTM. Marco Wittmann (GER) shone in the Sunday race, securing a podium finish in second place during a dramatic season finale.

After finishing seventh on Saturday, Rast started Sunday’s race from fifth position but quickly moved up to second place in the first few corners thanks to a brilliant start. However, at the hairpin, he was pushed wide and, as a result of a chain reaction, was hit twice by other cars. His #33 RoboMarkets BMW M4 GT3 EVO sustained such severe damage that he had to retire from the race in the very first lap, ending his bid for a fourth DTM title. A victory, which was well within reach, would have been enough to crown him champion. Thus, Rast concluded what is, at least for now, his final DTM season in position sixth in the drivers' standings.

On Friday, Rast had already announced that he would not compete in DTM in 2026, choosing instead to focus on other race programmes with BMW M Motorsport. Over eight full seasons, Rast achieved three titles, 31 victories, and 26 pole positions. He did not rule out a potential return to DTM at a later date.

For Marco Wittmann, the season ended with a fantastic comeback and a dramatic final lap. Starting from 17th on the grid, Wittmann climbed to second place and challenged Ayhancan Güven (TUR, Porsche) for the race win in the final sprint, as Güven was fighting for the championship title. Wittmann initially overtook Güven but was countered by a bold move from Güven just a few corners before the finish line. Thanks to his second-place finish, Wittmann ended the season in position five in the drivers' standings. Schubert Motorsport secured second place in the team standings. The team from Oschersleben (GER) celebrated a total of three victories by Rast and six additional podium finishes in 2025 – two for Rast and four for Wittmann.

ADAC GT Masters: Podium finish for FK Performance Motorsport to close the season. As in the DTM, BMW M Motorsport teams and drivers were in the title fight until the final weekend in Hockenheim in the supporting series ADAC GT Masters and ADAC GT4 Germany. However, the ultimate success also eluded them there. In the ADAC GT Masters, the FK Performance Motorsport duo Leyton Fourie (RSA) and Tim Zimmermann (GER) in the #11 BMW M4 GT3 EVO ended the season on a positive note with a second-place podium finish.

Andreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): "Congratulations to Marco Wittmann for a fantastic podium finish in Sunday’s race. That was a very strong performance. However, looking at the championship, the disappointment naturally outweighs the positives. After Marco was practically out of the race on Saturday due to a tyre issue, things looked very promising for René Rast. He had a strong weekend and was already in second place after the start on Sunday. Unfortunately, the collision at the hairpin cost him all his chances. We would have preferred to fight for the title until the final lap, but it wasn’t meant to be. Many thanks to everyone at BMW M Motorsport and Schubert Motorsport for a very good season with the BMW M4 GT3 EVO. We were in the title race with both drivers until the final weekend, which underscores our consistently strong performance. The pit stops by the crews were especially outstanding. Congratulations to Ayhancan Güven and Manthey EMA on winning the title!"

Björn Lellmann (Head of Customer Racing at BMW M Motorsport): "We can all be proud of this DTM season. We were in the title fight until the very end and have made significant progress compared to last year. René Rast and Marco Wittmann were very close throughout the season and brought success to the team together. It’s bitter that the season ended this way. We lost René in the first lap, and Marco would have deserved the win in the final race. Unfortunately, it wasn’t meant to be, but we’ll come back stronger next season. In the ADAC GT Masters and ADAC GT4 Germany, we unfortunately lost our title chances as well. Nevertheless, the podium finish for FK Performance Motorsport in the ADAC GT Masters is a positive conclusion. Our teams and drivers have learned a lot and will surely come back stronger."

Torsten Schubert (Team Principal, Schubert Motorsport): "It’s incredibly unfortunate that René Rast’s race ended so early today. He was already past Ayhancan Güven but was then pushed wide, leading to the unfortunate collision. Such incidents can happen in the tight DTM starts. You could see from Marco Wittmann's pace, the strong strategy, and the quick pit stops what would have been possible for René today as well. Marco stormed from 17th to second place and truly deserved the win. He drove a fantastic race. Overall, we had a good season and celebrated several victories. Our pit stops were consistently top-level. It would have been well-deserved for us to finish at the top of the championship standings. But we’ll take it as it is and come back stronger next season."

Marco Wittmann (#11 Schaeffler BMW M4 GT3 EVO, R1: 18th place, R2: 2nd place): "Climbing from 17th to second was a strong statement to end the season, I think. The final lap is certainly up for debate. I was already past Ayhancan Güven, and his counter-move in the Sachs Curve was borderline from my perspective. Nevertheless, it was a nice season finale for me. Of course, I feel very sorry for René that he was taken out of the race so early. I think we had a strong package today. Overall, it was a crazy season with a title fight that I believe is rare in DTM. We lost too much ground at some events, which ultimately took us out of the title fight. Still, we can be satisfied in the end. This season provides a solid foundation to build on."

René Rast (#33 RoboMarkets BMW M4 GT3 EVO, R1: 7th place, R2: DNF): "I’m at a loss for words after this bitter end to the season. My start in Sunday’s race was fantastic; I was already in second place, and the pace of our car was excellent. I think a win was absolutely possible. To be taken out of the title fight in this way in the first lap is incredibly bitter. This is not the conclusion I had dreamed of for my DTM career. However, I decided some time ago to at least temporarily end my DTM journey. I will not be competing in the DTM in 2026. This decision was not an easy one for me, as this racing series has been like a second home to me. I would like to sincerely thank all the teams I have raced with, the mechanics who gave their all in the garage, and the engineers who never stopped striving for perfection. Without your hard work and passion, my successes would not have been possible. I am also deeply grateful for the memories, the victories, the challenges, and especially for the fans who have supported me every step of the way. Even though I won’t be on the DTM grid next year, I am excited about the opportunities ahead – and who knows what the future will bring?"

Spa-Francorchamps. The Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps (BEL) is known as the Ardennes rollercoaster, and BMW M Motorsport experienced an emotional rollercoaster of its own there this weekend. At the third round of the 2025 FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC) and the home round for BMW M Team WRT, the “6 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps,” both BMW M Hybrid V8s once again demonstrated their potential following the podium finish in Imola (ITA). This time, however, it went unrewarded. The #20 Hypercar was in the fight for another podium finish until shortly before the end. A slow puncture set the car back before it had to retire for safety reasons due to a brake issue. The #15 BMW M Hybrid V8 also showed strong performance, but, after an eventful six hours, it was only enough for tenth place.

With perfect spring weather and an impressive crowd of nearly 100,000 spectators over the weekend, the stage was set for an exciting FIA WEC race. Each of the two BMW M Hybrid V8 cars was driven by a duo instead of the usual trio. Kevin Magnussen (DEN) and Raffaele Marciello (SUI) drove the #15, while René Rast (GER) and Robin Frijns (NED) shared driving duties in the #20. Their teammates Dries Vanthoor (BEL) and Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) are competing this weekend with the BMW M Hybrid V8 in the North American IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship at Laguna Seca (USA).

At the start, Magnussen sprinted from 11th on the grid into the top five with the #15 before handing over to Marciello. In the eventful race that followed, with several safety car periods, the car, however, was set back by two drive-through penalties. Rast initially ran outside the top ten in the #20, but he and Frijns made steady progress thanks to a strong performance and good strategy. Frijns eventually pushed the BMW M Hybrid V8 into podium contention with bold moves. But half an hour before the end, he had to return to the pits due to brake problems, and the team decided not to send the car back out.

Even though the race outcome did not meet expectations, BMW M Motorsport and BMW M Team WRT gathered valuable data in preparation for the season highlight – the 24 Hours of Le Mans (FRA). The endurance classic at the Sarthe will be held as the fourth round of the 2025 FIA WEC on 14th /15th June.

In the LMGT3 class, the crews of both BMW M4 GT3 EVOs had a difficult weekend. Ahmad Al Harthy (OMA), Valentino Rossi (ITA) and Kelvin van der Linde (RSA), who had narrowly missed out on victory in Imola with a second-place finish, came ninth in class with the Team WRT #46 car. The race ended early for the #31 The Bend Team WRT BMW M4 GT3 EVO during the second hour. Following contact, damage occurred in the suspension area, and the trio of Augusto Farfus (BRA), Timur Boguslavskiy and Yasser Shahin (AUS) had to retire.

Comments after the race:

Andreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “If you look at the race result alone, it’s obviously not what we had hoped for here at the home race for BMW M Team WRT. Also given the performance we showed with both BMW M Hybrid V8s, we had expected more in the end. It was frustrating that car number 15 received two penalties. That, unfortunately, set the car back, and it was difficult to fight for a top result after that. Car number 20 was very strong throughout the entire race. It was great to see that we were once again able to fight for top positions and were back on course for the podium. Unfortunately, we first had a slow puncture and then a brake issue that we still need to examine more closely. For safety reasons, we decided to retire the car. So, our conclusion is: the performance was there again, but, of course, we also want to achieve the corresponding results. In the LMGT3 class, the outcome was also not what we had hoped for after the strong race in Imola. Unfortunately, car number 31 retired early after contact. Car number 46 did a race without mistakes, but, unfortunately, the performance wasn’t enough today to fight for the front. We will continue working and are now looking forward to Le Mans. There, we want to show our full strength again and be at the very front.”

Vincent Vosse (Team Principal, BMW M Team WRT): “A disappointing weekend overall. At some stages, it looked like we could fight for a podium, but, in the end, that wasn’t the case. Car #20 was forced to retire due to what looks like brake issues. We will investigate further. As for car #15, two drive-through penalties made it impossible to aim for a stronger result. Ferrari had the race under control, and there wasn’t much we could do to challenge them. In LMGT3, it was also a tough outcome. Car #31 retired early after being involved in an incident, which was very disappointing. With car #46, we maximised what we could with the pace we had, but it wasn't enough to fight for the podium. We took a strategic gamble, but, unfortunately, it didn’t pay off. We’ll analyse, we’ll learn, and we’ll come back stronger.”

Kevin Magnussen (BMW M Team WRT, #15 BMW M Hybrid V8, 10th place): “It was unfortunate to get the two drive–through penalties. Apart from that, we had a strong start to the race. We showed a decent form, but then we were just fighting to make up from the two penalties. But it has been a good effort from the whole team. The other car also showed great performance, fighting all the way up to the top. Unfortunately there was no reward.”

Robin Frijns (BMW M Team WRT, #20 BMW M Hybrid V8, DNF): “I think it was an exciting race overall. The start wasn’t ideal, but we recovered well and made our way forward. Our pace was decent, even though we were not the fastest in the field, but we made smart strategy calls that kept us in the mix. On my side, there was some proper racing, with elbows out! Unfortunately, we had to retire due to a brake issue towards the end, which is a real shame as a podium was definitely within reach. But that’s racing.”

Valentino Rossi (Team WRT, #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, 9th place LMGT3 class): “We finished P9. That reflects our potential this weekend, given the pace we had. It was still a good race overall: we fought hard in the beginning of the race, we gained positions and even battled for the podium. Unfortunately, a drive-through penalty set us back, and we took a strategic gamble to try and move up the order, knowing we couldn’t gain much on outright pace. In the end, it didn’t play out in our favour. We’ll keep pushing and hope to be more competitive next time.”

Augusto Farfus (The Bend Team WRT, #31 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, DNF LMGT3 class): “It’s disappointing to come away with zero points. The incident with Yasser was unfortunate and not how we wanted our race to end. The team always put in so much hard work and effort and I wish we could reward them. Hopefully next time, at Le Mans, we will do just that.”

# Charge faster, drive further: BMW Group reveals revolutionary electric drive concept with 800V technology for the Neue Klasse
## +++ Sixth generation of BMW eDrive technology marks a milestone in electric mobility +++ BMW Energy Master: intelligent central control unit for the fundamentally new high-voltage battery – developed and produced in-house +++ Expertise from the e-mobility value chain in Bavaria and Austria pooled together +++ Innovative and flexible modular principle for electric drive +++

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Munich/Landshut. The BMW Group is presenting its next leap forward in the field of electric drive technology – and in the process ushering in a new era of all-electric driving. At the Tech Days event in Landshut, the company has provided some initial insights into the development and production of high-voltage batteries and electric drive systems using the sixth generation of BMW eDrive technology. Every fully electric Neue Klasse vehicle will enjoy the benefits. The first Neue Klasse model will go into series production later this year at Plant Debrecen in Hungary. Below is an overview of the technology highlights:

Adopting a technology-open approach while setting the pace in electric mobility

“For the BMW Group, electric mobility is the future and a key area of growth. We are leading the way with this drivetrain technology. At the same time, we are deliberately taking a technology-open approach, recognizing that mobility needs vary between different regions of the world,” explains Dr Joachim Post, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Purchasing and Supplier Network. “We want to offer our customers the best drive concept for every need. It is possible to do both: offer the best drive technology for every need and be at the forefront of electric mobility.”

Slimmer, faster, further: the high-voltage batteries for Gen6

With the new sixth-generation BMW eDrive technology (Gen6 for short), the BMW Group is making a technological quantum leap. Improvements on the product side include a 30% faster charging speed and 30% increase in range, with certain models achieving even higher figures. Added to which, the Gen6 high-voltage battery concept benefits from the new 800V technology. Gen6 will make its debut this year in the Neue Klasse and subsequently be used to drive models across the BMW Group’s fully electric product range. The concept for the Gen6 high-voltage batteries is fundamentally new and will find applications in all vehicle segments – right up to the high-performance models from BMW M GmbH. Its new, even slimmer design allows the high-voltage battery to be integrated into a spread of different models, regardless of vehicle height. The high-voltage battery takes on the role of a structural component in the bodies of the Neue Klasse models (“pack-to-open-body”), and the new cylindrical cells will be integrated directly into the high-voltage battery (“cell-to-pack”). The new BMW cylindrical cell has a 20% greater energy density than its predecessor, the Gen5 prismatic battery cell. And charging in both directions will be possible: the BMW Group has confirmed bidirectional charging as an option for Gen6.

Highly intelligent central control unit: the BMW Energy Master

All of the elements that enable this technological leap forward come together in the BMW Energy Master. This central control unit is positioned on the high-voltage battery and provides the interface for high- and low-voltage power supply and for data from the high-voltage battery. It also controls the power supply for the electric motor and vehicle electrical system and ensures the safe and intelligent operation of the high-voltage battery. The BMW Group has filed a whole series of new patent applications for the vehicle electrical system, including its electronic fuses. Both the hardware and software of the Energy Master were developed fully in-house at the BMW Group. This ensures technological developments and updates for vehicles can be implemented independently and in real time via Remote Software Upgrades, providing a particular benefit for customers.

“Local for local” approach for high-voltage battery assembly and supplier network

The high-voltage batteries for the Neue Klasse are assembled in five new production facilities that the BMW Group has located close to its vehicle plants as part of a “local for local” approach. For example, cutting-edge assembly locations for Gen6 high-voltage batteries are taking shape in Irlbach-Straßkirchen (Lower Bavaria), Debrecen (Hungary), Shenyang (China), San Luis Potosí (Mexico) and Woodruff, near Spartanburg (USA). This approach safeguards production even in the event of unforeseen political and economic events. In addition, the existing locations are being strengthened, with jobs both secured and created. The “local for local” principle continues in the supplier network for battery cells: in order to cover the demand for Gen6, the BMW Group has reached contractual agreements for five battery cell factories – spread across Europe, China and the USA – with various partners.

“Cell-to-pack” and “pack-to-open-body”

Production of the Gen6 high-voltage batteries follows the “cell-to-pack” and “pack-to-open-body” principles. “Cell-to-pack” involves positioning the cylindrical cells – manufactured by the suppliers according to BMW Group specifications – directly in the housing of the high-voltage battery, without the intermediate step of a module being produced. “Pack-to-open-body” refers to the high-voltage battery’s new role as a structural component in the vehicle architecture. Numerous innovations patented by the BMW Group can be found here.

Know-how from Bavaria and Austria – in demand around the world

Before series production of the high-voltage batteries gets underway worldwide, the production processes will be developed and pre-series batteries subjected to thorough testing. This will happen at the BMW Group pilot plants for high-voltage batteries in Parsdorf, Hallbergmoos and Munich. The new series production plants around the world will then be ready. The product and process expertise is centred in Bavaria. Production of the Energy Master will take place at Plant Landshut, which will then supply all the high-voltage battery assembly plants around the world. There, the highly intelligent control unit will be installed on the high-voltage battery. The electric motor with sixth-generation BMW eDrive technology is produced at Plant Steyr in Austria, which is also home to a development centre for electric drive systems and thermal management.

Production of the Energy Master at BMW Group Plant Landshut

A state-of-the-art production system for the BMW Energy Master is taking shape at Plant Landshut. The plant is currently producing the highly complex control unit in pre-series. Series production on the first production line will begin in August 2025, with a further expansion stage to follow in mid-2026. This is the first time the development and production of this central control unit has taken place in-house at the BMW Group. “As the company’s largest in-house component manufacturer, Landshut plays an important role for the Neue Klasse,” says Dr Joachim Post. “The plant is an innovation hub and a driver of transformation.” [ADDRESS] people will be employed in the Energy Master production area at Landshut when production begins, rising to as many as 700 people as it ramps up further. The BMW Group has channelled investment in the high hundreds of millions of euros into the expansion of electric mobility at Plant Landshut since 2020, strengthening both the production facility itself and Germany’s status as an industrial powerhouse for the long term. The modular manufacturing system used to produce the Energy Master was also designed fully in-house by the BMW Group. It is supplied with subcomponents by a supply chain set up by the BMW Group. This extends to the n-tier supply chain for supply-critical components such as semiconductors. The benefits of this set-up can be seen in terms of both costs and supply security. The scalable production system enables the company to respond quickly and flexibly to market requirements. The high degree of automation, involving up to 400 robots in the final expansion stage, maximises efficiency. Comprehensive in-process monitoring, which includes the use of AI-based camera systems, and 100-per-cent end-of-line system checks in a clean-room environment ensure optimum quality.

Different recycling processes within the value chain

As electric mobility ramps up, there is an increasing focus on recycling of high-voltage batteries at the end of their lifecycle. Under a long-term partnership with SK tes – a leading provider of innovative technology lifecycle solutions – cobalt, nickel and lithium from end-of-life batteries are recovered from the BMW Group and integrated into the supply chain for the manufacture of new batteries. This closed-loop approach increases the efficiency and resilience of the BMW Group as part of a circular economy. The BMW Group will follow a similar path in the USA, Mexico and Canada up to 2026 with a separate partnership.

Innovative direct recycling at the BMW Group

The BMW Group is also exploring other recycling options in the value creation process. One example of this is the direct recycling method developed in-house. The BMW Group is working with its joint venture Encory to set up a competence centre for battery cell recycling in Lower Bavaria, where the company will put its direct recycling ideas into practice. This innovative process will enable residual materials from battery cell production and whole battery cells to be mechanically broken down into their valuable constituent components. The raw materials obtained in this way will be re-used directly in the pilot production process for battery cells at the company’s competence centres.

Technology-open approach for electric mobility: the new e-drive system of Gen6

The BMW Group has retained the principle of an electrically excited synchronous motor (EESM) for its Gen6 power unit. On this type of synchronous motor, the magnetic field in the rotor is generated by windings fed with direct current rather than permanent magnets. In this way, the strength of the rotor’s magnetic field can be optimally adjusted to the prevailing load conditions. This results in both excellent levels of efficiency at customer-relevant operating points and constant power output at high rotational speeds. As with the Gen5 version, the synchronous motor will be positioned above the rear axle and feature a compact housing incorporating the electric drive unit, power electronics and transmission. Many of the motor’s technical details were created with the help of patented expertise, with the rotor alone accounting for more than ten patent applications.

Neue Klasse additionally incorporates ASM technology

The Gen6 powertrain employs a second, additional electric motor technology in the form of the asynchronous motor (ASM). Here, instead of being generated by permanent magnets (PSM) or electrical excitation (EESM), the rotor’s magnetic field is induced by the stator. On this type of motor, the rotor takes the form of a metal cage. The asynchronous motor offers the advantage of a more compact design and superior cost efficiency. The ASM motor variants will be fitted at the front axle of Neue Klasse cars with BMW xDrive.

Extensive improvements to EESM technology

Besides the addition of ASM technology, the EESM technology has also undergone a major upgrade for Gen6: rotor, stator and inverter have all been fully designed for the new 800V architecture of the Gen6 tech in order to maximise drive system performance and efficiency. This has been further helped by a complete redesign of the oil and water cooling systems. In addition to this, the experts from the BMW Group have also succeeded in improving the electric motor and central housing in terms of their weight and rigidity too. The transmission still uses a two-stage helical design, but has been further optimised by enhancements to its geometry and cooling, lower friction levels and more pleasant acoustics. The electrically excited synchronous motor’s “brain”, the inverter, now features 800V technology along with silicon carbide (SiC) semiconductors to boost efficiency. The inverter is completely integrated into the electric motor’s housing. Its task is to convert the DC power supply from the high-voltage battery to AC for use in the electric motor. The inverter was developed in-house by the BMW Group and is produced at Plant Steyr in Austria.

Lower weight, costs and energy losses – greater efficiency in the vehicle

The results obtained from intelligently incorporating new technologies into the electric powertrain while consistently enhancing existing systems make impressive reading. When compared to a Gen5 xDrive model, a future Neue Klasse model complete with EESM and ASM technology boasts the following improvements: energy losses have been reduced by 40%, costs by 20% and weight by 10%. By combining different types of electric motor, the BMW Group’s technology-open approach is therefore clearly in evidence within the field of electric mobility. In future, customers will be able to choose from models equipped with one, two, three or four electric motors to suit their individual preferences and requirements. The sixth generation BMW eDrive technology is a significant factor in the gain in overall vehicle efficiency of around 20 per cent for the Neue Klasse. This figure is based on a comparison with the current generation of all-electric vehicles from the BMW Group.

Modular concept provides crucial advantage for manufacturing electric motors

The manufacturing concept for the Gen6 electric drive system uses the principle of modular building blocks. This forms the basis for highly flexible manufacturing of various electric drive variants across the entire Neue Klasse model range. The modular "building block” concept leads to positive economies of scale and cost savings in development and production. It also has the effect of improving the scalability of production volumes. The modular approach ensures a high degree of flexibility in production, the supply networks and procurement.

The Gen6 electric drive systems: made in Steyr

Series production of the Gen6 electric drive systems will commence at BMW Group Plant Steyr in summer 2025. Pre-production already got underway at the Austrian facility in September 2024. The pre-production motors are undergoing rigorous testing and some are already being fitted in Neue Klasse test vehicles from Plant Debrecen. By 2030, the BMW Group will have invested over one billion euros at the site since the project’s launch in 2022 to expand its development and production expertise for electric drive systems. Thanks to the increase in capacity, the plant will retain its status as the BMW Group’s leading facility for drive systems. The plant has been developing and building combustion engines for the BMW and MINI brands for over 40 years. Plant Steyr’s many years of experience and high level of expertise in the field of drive systems make it the ideal site for manufacturing the Gen6 electric motors. Diesel and petrol engines continue to be manufactured there alongside the electric motors. By 2030, around half of the on-site employees should be working in electric mobility – a vital step for safeguarding the more than 4,700 jobs at the plant in the long term. In future, all key components of the innovative, highly integrated electric drive unit – i.e. the rotor, stator, transmission, inverter and housing – will be produced at Steyr. This will include manufacturing the inverters in an in-house clean room environment for the first time, thereby taking the engine plant into the realm of electrical engineering. The electric drive components will be built on two new assembly lines at Steyr.

Thermal management: complex interaction, crucial for performance Thermal management involves highly complex interaction between various systems in an electric vehicle and is of critical importance for a host of performance parameters, including range, real-world consumption, acceleration and charging time. Thermal management is a question of constantly keeping the temperature of the electric motor, power electronics and high-voltage battery in the optimum range, while maintaining standards of passenger comfort at the same time. Efficient thermal management is important for fast charging too. Here, the battery temperature must be kept within a defined window in order to make optimum use of the available charging capacity. Unlike combustion engines, electric motors give off little heat. This means that, depending on the operating state, the battery and the passenger cell have to be not only cooled, but heated too. The Steyr site develops the thermal management systems for all electric vehicles from the BMW Group. The plant’s development centre is also responsible for the brain at the heart of the electric motor – the inverter.

BMW Group Plant Landshut – a multi-talented component manufacturer

BMW Group Plant Landshut is the BMW Group’s largest component plant anywhere in the world, supplying components to all the company’s vehicle and drive system plants. Its workforce of around 3,700 employees produces a broad spectrum of cutting-edge components for vehicles from the BMW Group. Working closely with the BMW Group’s Research and Innovation Centre (FIZ) in Munich, Plant Landshut plays a pivotal role as a hub of innovation for the automotive industry. It develops pioneering technologies and manufacturing processes that serve to maintain the company’s competitive edge. Over the course of the Neue Klasse project, the site is investing some €200 million in its light metal foundry to increase annual production capacity for the electric motor housings. The Injector Casting (ICA) process developed and patented in Landshut is a prime example of the plant’s innovative strength. This globally unique process is used to manufacture the electric motors’ highly complex aluminium housings that set new standards for lightweight design and functional integration.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fuji. Second place in Austin (USA), third place in Fuji (JPN): the BMW M4 GT3 EVO continues its successful streak in the final stages of the FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC). In the penultimate race at the Fuji International Speedway, Augusto Farfus (BRA), Timur Boguslavskiy, and Yasser Shahin (AUS) drove the #31 The Bend Team WRT BMW M4 GT3 EVO to a third-place finish. The trio achieved an impressive comeback from 14th on the grid. The #46 car, which had finished second in Austin, secured another strong fourth-place result this time. In the Hypercar class, the #20 Shell BMW M Hybrid V8 crossed the finish line in ninth place, while the #15 car retired after a crash.

The Japanese fans witnessed a spectacular six-hour race filled with numerous overtakes and collisions. Unfortunately, the #15 BMW M Hybrid V8, driven by Kevin Magnussen (DEN), Raffaele Marciello (SUI), and Dries Vanthoor (BEL), was involved in two incidents. First, Magnussen was hit and spun by another car. Later, Marciello had to avoid a suddenly slowing Hypercar, resulting in a crash into the track barrier, which ended the race for the car.

The #20 car started from an excellent fifth position after a strong qualifying performance by Sheldon van der Linde (RSA). During the race, he and his teammates René Rast (GER) and Robin Frijns (NED) fought hard to recover after a drive-through penalty. Their efforts concluded with a ninth-place finish.

Both BMW M4 GT3 EVO cars in the LMGT3 class delivered spectacular comebacks. After a disappointing qualifying session, the cars started from 11th and 14th positions but quickly worked their way up the field. The final stages turned into a strategic gamble, with the #31 car securing a well-earned third place. Right behind, Kelvin van der Linde (RSA), Valentino Rossi (ITA), and Ahmad Al Harthy (OMA) finished fourth in the #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO.

Comments after the race:

Andreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): "On the Hypercar side, it was a tough weekend. After our first podium in FIA WEC here a year ago, we had hoped for much more than ninth place. Unfortunately, we had some bad luck during the race with yellow flags and safety cars. On top of that, the #20 car received a drive-through penalty. Ultimately, we also lacked that final bit of pace needed to achieve a top result. I feel sorry for the #15 crew who were involved in two collisions through no fault of their own. On the other side of the garage, there is great joy over another podium for the BMW M4 GT3 EVO. Third and fourth places are the result of fantastic team performances. Congratulations to Augusto Farfus, Timur Boguslavskiy, and Yasser Shahin on the podium finish. Our goal now is to deliver a strong season finale in Bahrain with all our cars."

Vincent Vosse (Team Principal, BMW M Team WRT): "Looking at the Hypercars, it was a disappointing weekend. Ultimately, the #20 car finished ninth. We had some bad luck with the safety car, but that wasn’t the end of the world. Even the winning #35 Alpine had a drive-through penalty. It was all about being in the right place at the right time. Congratulations to the Alpine crew on their first FIA WEC victory. As for us, the #15 car was heavily damaged after Raffaele Marciello’s crash. It seems the car in front of him suddenly slowed down due to technical issues, and he couldn’t avoid the accident. The third and fourth places in the LMGT3 class were achieved thanks to our fantastic teamwork. We didn’t have the best pace, but we did a flawless job."

Robin Frijns (BMW M Team WRT, #20 Shell BMW M Hybrid V8, 9th place): "A tough weekend. From the first practice session, we didn’t have the pace we had hoped for. We managed to improve, but in the end, we weren’t fast enough. In qualifying, we definitely overperformed with fifth place thanks to a fantastic lap by Sheldon. In the race, we had a bit of bad luck and a drive-through penalty, but we were still in a decent position. However, we couldn’t hold onto it due to our lack of pace."

Raffaele Marciello (BMW M Team WRT, #15 BMW M Hybrid V8, DNF): "It’s very unfortunate that we had to end the race this way. I’m curious about the outcome of the investigation into my crash. Overall, it was a tough weekend, and we lacked some pace. Still, after the early contact, we made up ground in the race and could have scored some points, especially since several cars ahead of us had penalties or incidents. Now we’re focusing on the season finale in Bahrain."

Augusto Farfus (The Bend Team WRT, #31 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, 3rd place): "Given the pace we had this weekend, we didn’t expect to move so far forward in the race but we did an excellent job. We had to overcome a few hurdles, but the team handled them brilliantly. The car was much better in the race than in qualifying. The podium feels very rewarding."

Timur Boguslavskiy (The Bend Team WRT, #31 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, 3rd place): "We’re very happy with this podium. We weren’t the fastest in the race, but we still earned third place. We were close in Austin, and this time it finally worked out. I’m not entirely satisfied with my own performance, but Augusto and Yasser did an amazing job."

Yasser Shahin (The Bend Team WRT, #31 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, 3rd place): "What a fantastic race result. We really didn’t think we had a chance but a great drive from all three drivers and all the right strategy calls delivered today."

Kelvin van der Linde (Team WRT, #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, 4th place): "Third and fourth places are a very good team result. This race marks the end of four extremely busy weeks. A podium in Austin, a podium here, plus wins in Suzuka and Valencia – it’s been an incredibly successful month for the team and for me personally. I’m proud of the entire crew."

Date: 2025-09-05 | Author: Matthias Bode BMW Group | ID: T0452425ES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Un elemento definitorio de la experiencia digital en el nuevo BMW iX3 es el BMW Panoramic iDrive, que se centra en la operación intuitiva y el enfoque en el conductor, características por las que la marca BMW es reconocida, a un nivel superior. Además, un concepto integral de sostenibilidad reduce la huella de carbono del producto a lo largo de su ciclo de vida en más del 30% en comparación con su predecesor.

El primer modelo de la Neue Klasse será fabricado inicialmente en BMW Group Planta Debrecen, en Hungría, más adelante también se producirán modelos Neue Klasse en México. La primera variante del SAV totalmente eléctrico que saldrá de la línea de producción en otoño de 2025 será el BMW iX3 50 xDrive (consumo eléctrico combinado: 17.9 – 15.1 kWh/100 km; clase de CO₂: A; autonomía: 679 – 805 km [421 – 500 millas]; cifras provisionales según WLTP) con una potencia de 345 kW/469 hp y tracción integral eléctrica. Seguirán más variantes totalmente eléctricas, incluyendo un modelo de entrada. El lanzamiento del mercado del nuevo BMW iX3 comenzará en Europa en primavera de 2026 y en Estados Unidos en verano de 2026. También, a partir del verano de 2026, se entregarán versiones del nuevo BMW iX3 producidas en la planta de Shenyang, específicamente adaptadas a las necesidades y deseos de los clientes en China.

El nuevo BMW iX3 representa un salto en desarrollo respecto a su predecesor del mismo nombre, que va mucho más allá de una simple renovación de modelo convencional. Los avances en diseño y tecnología crean la impresión de que se ha saltado una generación completa de vehículos. Para BMW Group, el lanzamiento del nuevo BMW iX3 también marca un hito en el proceso de transformación en temas de electrificación, digitalización y circularidad. Liderando la llegada de la Neue Klasse, ofrece a los clientes las últimas innovaciones en diseño y tecnología, que darán forma a toda la gama de modelos de la marca en el futuro. Las tecnologías de la Neue Klasse se incorporarán en un total de 40 nuevos modelos y actualizaciones de modelos entre el día de hoy y el 2027.

“La Neue Klasse es nuestro mayor proyecto de futuro y representa un gran salto en tecnologías, experiencia de conducción y diseño,” dice [EXECUTIVE_OFFICER], Presidente del Consejo de Administración de BMW AG. “Prácticamente todo en ella es nuevo, pero también es más BMW que nunca. Toda nuestra gama de productos se beneficiará de las innovaciones de la Neue Klasse, independientemente de la tecnología de propulsión. Lo que empezó como una visión audaz ahora se ha convertido en realidad: el BMW iX3 es el primer modelo de la Neue Klasse en entrar en producción en serie. No solo estamos llevando a la carretera la próxima generación de uno de nuestros vehículos totalmente eléctricos más exitosos, sino que estamos lanzando una nueva era para BMW.”

Lanzamiento del nuevo lenguaje de diseño: sencillo, con carácter y atemporal. Los avances tecnológicos importantes siempre brindan la oportunidad de introducir cambios de diseño más significativos. El nuevo BMW iX3 lanzará el nuevo lenguaje de diseño de BMW, que pronto se replicará en toda la gama de modelos de la marca. Este uso renovado de las formas ofrece una interpretación muy moderna del concepto original y perdurable de BMW. El diseño es atemporal, a la vez que captura el espíritu del momento. Se reduce a la esencia de la marca BMW – y por eso mismo, es más BMW que nunca. Por esta razón, se ha registrado una patente de protección integral del diseño para el nuevo lenguaje de diseño de BMW utilizado en el nuevo BMW iX3.

El nuevo BMW iX3 refleja los valores y cualidades de la Neue Klasse dentro del concepto de un SAV. El primer modelo X de la nueva generación se centra en el espacio interior y un estilo de vida progresista. [ADDRESS],782 milímetros de longitud, 1,895 milímetros de ancho y 1,635 milímetros de altura, el nuevo BMW iX3 tiene las proporciones características de un SAV. El diseño de doble volumen, infundido con la presencia robusta de un modelo BMW X, cuenta con líneas precisas que resaltan las cuatro ruedas. La optimización de detalles en la aerodinámica del vehículo permite un coeficiente de arrastre (Cd) de 0.24.

La capacidad del maletero del nuevo BMW iX3 puede aumentarse de 520 a un máximo de 1,750 litros plegando los respaldos de los asientos traseros según sea necesario. El compartimento de almacenamiento adicional bajo el cofre puede contener 58 litros adicionales de carga. Los clientes que requieran mayor capacidad de transporte pueden solicitar su auto con la preparación para remolque. La capacidad máxima del remolque del nuevo BMW iX3 50 xDrive es de 2,000 kilogramos.

La parte frontal alta y las superficies claramente definidas confieren al nuevo BMW iX3 una presencia considerable. Los riñones típicos de BMW y los faros dobles – ambos distintivos del diseño de BMW – asumen el protagonismo visual. Los riñones con diseño escultórico hacen referencia a la Neue Klasse de los años 60 en su disposición vertical. Un estilo de iluminación completamente nuevo asume el papel que anteriormente desempeñaba el cromo, otorgando al auto un aura de calidad y sofisticación. Desde una vista lateral, grandes superficies fragmentadas por un pequeño número de líneas precisas crean una apariencia llena de carácter. Las superficies de cristal empotradas y las manijas de las puertas también son características del diseño lateral. La estatura robusta del nuevo BMW iX3 se acentúa con arcos de rueda del color de la carrocería y, en el estilo familiar de BMW X, con contornos sutilmente rectangulares. La parte trasera también presenta una figura potente y atlética. Las luces traseras, que se extienden claramente hacia el centro, representan una interpretación horizontal de la firma en forma de “L” de BMW.

Diseño interior: un espacio moderno con enfoque típico BMW para el conductor y confort excepcional para todos los pasajeros. El diseño interior del BMW iX3 establece nuevos estándares en modernidad y experiencia digital. La cabina presenta un diseño simple y claro, que proporciona el escenario ideal para la experiencia digital. La cabina se define por su claro enfoque en el conductor, por el cual BMW es reconocido, y en el confort para todos los ocupantes. Diseñada específicamente para vehículos eléctricos, la arquitectura del vehículo permite niveles de espacio extremadamente generosos en los cinco asientos. Las líneas del panel de instrumentos “flotante” fluyen directamente hacía los grandes revestimientos de las puertas, creando un efecto envolvente para los pasajeros. Con su superficie de tela, el panel de instrumentos – con iluminación ambiental – contribuye a una atmósfera cálida y acogedora en el interior. Grandes superficies de ventana y el techo panorámico opcional con acristalamiento de confort climático generan un ambiente luminoso.

Otra influencia destacada en el tablero de instrumentos horizontal es el nuevo sistema de control/operación BMW Panoramic iDrive, que se basa en el recién desarrollado BMW Operating System X. Reúne pantallas, geometría, diseño de luz y sonido en una experiencia holística, personalizable a través de My Modes. También participan en esto los nuevos sonidos de conducción, efectos y señales sonoros del paisaje acústico BMW HypersonX, creado específicamente para la Neue Klasse.

Los asientos de diseño nuevo y elegante destacan por su excelente confort en viajes largos, carácter deportivo y amplia gama de ajustes. También con un diseño completamente nuevo son el volante y la consola central entre el asiento del conductor y el pasajero delantero, con áreas de almacenamiento y controles. El asiento trasero ofrece una superficie de asiento tipo sofá.

Los mundos interiores cuidadosamente diseñados aportan un carácter único y totalmente distinto a cada paquete de equipamiento. Los materiales y esquemas de color seleccionados están inspirados en el diseño interior moderno y en la avanzada tecnología de la Neue Klasse, y se coordinan de manera armoniosa entre sí. Por lo tanto, contribuyen de manera visible y notable al nivel excepcional de confort a bordo del nuevo BMW iX3. Una atractiva gama de colores permite la combinación perfecta entre los tonos interiores y los acabados exteriores. Como alternativas al diseño interior Essential en Vivid Grey con tapicería Econeer, los clientes también pueden elegir entre tres composiciones más, en Veganza, el mundo interior BMW M en Veganza y M PerformTex, y la opción BMW Individual con una combinación de cuero Merino de alta calidad y M PerformTex en Negro Bicolor o Gris Adelaide.

El nuevo BMW iX3 puede solicitarse como opción con los paquetes M Sport o M Sport Pro desde el lanzamiento. Su aspecto dinámico se acentúa con detalles en negro de alto brillo en el exterior, asientos M Sport y un volante M en el interior del vehículo.

El paquete exterior BMW Iconic Glow permite una impresionante secuencia de sonido y luz con estilos Relaxed, Balanced y Excited. La secuencia de bienvenida comienza en cuanto el conductor se acerca al vehículo y, al sentarse, un saludo animado inicia en BMW Panoramic Vision y en la Pantalla Central, extendiéndose suavemente del lado del conductor hacia el del acompañante.

BMW Panoramic iDrive: enfoque completo en el conductor, con estilo BMW. El BMW iX3 es el primer modelo de producción en serie en el que BMW Panoramic iDrive redefine la experiencia del usuario y, por ende, también el placer de conducir puro. Con su equilibrado balance entre funciones digitales y elementos físicos, BMW Panoramic iDrive eleva la operación intuitiva – siguiendo el famoso principio de BMW “manos en el volante, ojos en la carretera” – a un nuevo nivel de enfoque en el conductor. Todo el sistema surge de décadas de experiencia y un diseño centrado en el usuario. Se incorporaron comentarios de clientes, datos de más de 10 millones de vehículos conectados y estudios de usabilidad con más de 3,000 clientes en el proceso de desarrollo. Los controles físicos están a la mano, incluyendo el limpiaparabrisas, las señales, los espejos exteriores, el control de volumen, la palanca de cambios, el freno de estacionamiento, las luces de emergencia, la calefacción y el desempañador del cristal trasero. Otras funciones se han optimizado para uso por toque, comando de voz o mediante el volante multifunción.

El BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant ha sido significativamente mejorado e incluye ahora dos nuevas voces, una nueva apariencia para BMW Panoramic Vision y asistencia adicional para el conductor mediante sugerencias proactivas y rutinas personalizables. La tecnología de Large Language Model (LLM) también se irá integrando gradualmente para facilitar una interacción por voz aún más intuitiva en el futuro.

BMW Panoramic iDrive combina cuatro elementos centrales en un sistema único de pantallas y controles. El BMW Panoramic Vision proyecta información a todo lo ancho del parabrisas, de pilar a pilar. El contenido en el centro y en el lado del pasajero puede adaptarse a gustos y necesidades personales. La información principal de conducción aparece en el campo visual del conductor. Y, por encima del BMW Panoramic Vision, el BMW Head-Up Display 3D (equipo opcional) ahora también puede mostrar la navegación integrada y las pantallas de conducción automatizada en la carretera con profundidad espacial. La pantalla central de diseño libre y retroiluminación de matriz se ubica en una posición ergonómicamente ideal junto al volante. A la izquierda, los widgets dispuestos verticalmente permiten acceso rápido y directo a funciones de uso frecuente mediante tecnología QuickSelect. El nuevo volante multifunción sirve como el principal punto de control físico. Sus paneles de botones ayudan a que el conductor y el vehículo trabajen de forma simbiótica, usando iluminación, superficies en relieve y retroalimentación háptica.

El BMW Operating System X, también recién desarrollado, respalda al BMW Panoramic iDrive y ofrece amplias opciones de personalización a través del BMW ID, asistencia inteligente al conductor, una gran variedad de funciones digitales, conectividad avanzada mediante la app My BMW y una sobresaliente preparación para el futuro gracias a las actualizaciones de software BMW.

El sistema de navegación estándar BMW Maps presenta una actualización para la guía de rutas optimizadas para carga, además de una presentación inteligente y coordinada de información en BMW Panoramic Vision, Pantalla Central y, opcionalmente, en el Head-Up Display 3D. La BMW Digital Key Plus puede configurarse en smartphones y relojes inteligentes de las principales marcas, también como estándar. Mientras tanto, BMW Operating System X desbloquea una amplia variedad de funciones entretenimiento en carretera y durante las paradas de carga, ofreciendo a los clientes no solo apps de transmisión de música como Spotify y juegos en coche con AirConsole, sino también una app de streaming de video con Disney+, YouTube y otras plataformas internacionales y específicas de cada país, con contenido a demanda y en vivo. La app Zoom para videollamadas también está disponible para su uso.

La BMW ConnectedDrive Store ofrece un resumen de las funciones que los clientes pueden descargar o acceder actualmente, y estas pueden añadirse de forma sencilla y flexible mediante ConnectedDrive Upgrades. Por ejemplo, en todo el mundo están disponibles más de 60 apps de terceros en categorías como música & audio, entretenimiento, juegos, noticias y viajes & localización. Para descargar las funciones y usar las apps, los clientes necesitarán conexión mediante BMW Digital Premium o una red WiFi/hotspot de smartphone. La gama de funciones BMW Digital Premium que los clientes pueden añadir a su gusto incluye funciones de seguridad avanzadas, mejoras en la navegación, datos ilimitados para entretenimiento y, ahora también, BMW M Apps.

Tecnología de sexta generación BMW eDrive: mayor eficiencia, más autonomía, carga más rápida La tecnología BMW eDrive de sexta generación, desarrollada para la Neue Klasse, comprende motores eléctricos altamente eficientes, nuevas baterías de alta tensión con celdas cilíndricas y tecnología de 800V. El BMW iX3 50 xDrive está equipado con dos motores eléctricos que, en conjunto, generan una potencia de 345 kW/469 hp y un torque de 645 Nm (475 lb-pie). Acelera de 0 a 100 km/h en 4.9 segundos y alcanza una velocidad máxima de 210 km/h. Su configuración de tracción integral eléctrica consiste en un motor síncrono excitado eléctricamente (EESM) altamente optimizado, con niveles de eficiencia especialmente altos en el eje trasero, y en el eje delantero, un motor asíncrono (ASM) nuevo, caracterizado por su diseño compacto y alta eficiencia de costos. La combinación de EESM y ASM es prueba del compromiso de BMW Group con la neutralidad tecnológica en la movilidad eléctrica. La tecnología de propulsión desarrollada para la Neue Klasse reduce las pérdidas de energía en un 40%, el peso en un 10% y los costos de fabricación en un 20% en comparación con la tecnología BMW eDrive de quinta generación.

La nueva batería de alta tensión con celdas cilíndricas para la Neue Klasse también logra avances significativos. La densidad de energía a nivel de celda es un 20% mayor que en la tecnología BMW eDrive de quinta generación, y el nuevo concepto también abre el camino para un aumento del 30% en la velocidad de carga. Las celdas cilíndricas se integran directamente en la batería de alta tensión (“celda a paquete”), lo que mejora la densidad de energía y la eficiencia de costos. Además, la batería de alta tensión se integra en la arquitectura del vehículo como un componente estructural para reducir peso (“paquete a carrocería”). La batería de alta tensión del BMW iX3 50 xDrive tiene una capacidad útil de 108.7 kWh, permitiendo una autonomía de hasta 805 kilómetros en ciclo WLTP.

BMW Charging: tiempos de carga cortos, estreno de carga bidireccional Los avances de la tecnología BMW eDrive de sexta generación también afectan significativamente la experiencia de carga. Una tasa máxima de carga de 400 kW permite a los usuarios llenar su nuevo BMW iX3 con suficiente energía en una estación de carga rápida de corriente continua (CC) de 800V para obtener hasta 372 kilómetros (231 millas)[1] de autonomía en solo diez minutos. La batería de alta tensión puede cargarse del 10 al 80% en 21 minutos. Gracias a la tecnología de gestión de la batería con matriz de conmutación integrada, desarrollada completamente en casa por BMW Group, el nuevo BMW iX3 también puede cargarse en estaciones de 400V CC. Las mejoras en la preparación de la batería también ayudan a reducir los tiempos de carga. El nuevo BMW iX3 50 xDrive puede recargar en corriente alterna (CA) hasta a 11 kW de serie o hasta 22 kW[2] como opción.

También están disponibles funciones de carga bidireccional[3] para el nuevo BMW iX3, lo que significa que puede usarse como fuente de energía para diversas aplicaciones. La función Vehicle-to-Load (V2L) convierte al nuevo BMW iX3 en un banco de potencia móvil, capaz de suministrar energía a dispositivos eléctricos mientras está en movimiento. Vehicle-to-Home (V2H) le otorga el papel de unidad de almacenamiento de energía solar generada por sistemas fotovoltaicos domésticos. Y los clientes también pueden conectar su auto al mercado energético mediante la aplicación Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) y ganar dinero en el proceso (la posibilidad de usar estas funcionalidades depende de la normatividad de energía en cada país).

La selección de accesorios de carga estándar y opcionales se ha ampliado significativamente. Para una carga flexible durante un viaje, los clientes pueden usar el nuevo cargador multifunción, que viene con varios adaptadores para cargar y descargar la batería de alta tensión. El nuevo BMW Wallbox Professional (DC) permite carga bidireccional en casa o en el trabajo. Además, BMW Charging ofrece la opción de carga doméstica optimizada por coste y energía solar. Un emblema de la experiencia de carga en esta nueva generación de vehículos es la tapa de carga inteligente del nuevo BMW iX3, que usa inteligencia artificial (IA) para detectar la intención del cliente de recargar su auto y, automáticamente, abrirla o cerrarla. Y la tecnología BMW eDrive de sexta generación permite visualizar la velocidad y curva de carga en la app My BMW. Hasta diez contratos de carga individuales de diversos proveedores pueden mostrarse digitalmente dentro del nuevo BMW iX3, permitiendo usar la función Plug & Charge Multi Contract.

Heart of Joy: el placer de conducir puro alcanza un nuevo nivel. Uno de los cuatro “supercerebros” en la arquitectura electrónica de la Neue Klasse, el Heart of Joy se encarga de la gestión del tren de transmisión y la dinámica de conducción. Esta unidad de control de alto rendimiento es responsable del tren de transmisión, frenos, recuperación de energía y subfunciones de dirección, y procesa la información hasta diez veces más rápido que las unidades de control convencionales. De esta manera, se aprovecha al máximo el potencial de la movilidad eléctrica en cuanto a entrega instantánea de potencia, transferencia suave, agilidad, estabilidad y eficiencia.

Junto con el paquete de software de control de rendimiento dinámico de BMW, desarrollada completamente en casa, el Heart of Joy calcula todos los parámetros de dinámica de conducción con un nuevo nivel de velocidad y precisión. Aquí, la experiencia de décadas de BMW en control de dinámica de conducción sale a la luz. El conductor y los pasajeros del nuevo BMW iX3 experimentan una sensación de conducción única, armoniosa y típica de BMW, sin importar la situación o la velocidad. Cada movimiento del acelerador, pedal de freno y volante se ejecuta de manera directa, segura y precisa. La tracción suprema y, gracias a la función de parada suave (Soft Stop), el proceso de frenado más suave jamás alcanzado por un BMW, son otras de sus cualidades. Además, la eficiencia del nuevo BMW iX3 se optimiza mediante la gestión integrada del tren de potencia, el sistema de frenos y la recuperación de energía. En la conducción diaria, el 98% de las maniobras de frenado se realizan solo mediante recuperación (frenado regenerativo), sin usar los frenos de fricción.

“Supercerebro de conducción automatizada” para los sistemas de asistencia al conductor con tecnología de próxima generación. Otra unidad de control de alto rendimiento reúne todas las funciones de conducción y estacionamiento automatizado en el BMW iX3. Con una potencia de procesamiento 20 veces mayor que las unidades de control convencionales, el “supercerebro de conducción automatizada” permite un avance tecnológico importante con la Neue Klasse en esta área también.

BMW Symbiotic Drive ofrece soporte sin interrupciones. El BMW iX3 usa su capacidad Symbiotic Drive, combinada con asistencia al conductor, para crear una experiencia de conducción completamente nueva. Siempre que el conductor quiera acelerar, frenar o dirigir, sus entradas se combinan de manera sencilla e intuitiva con el software habilitado por IA.

El resultado es una nueva forma de placer de conducir puro. Estas funciones de asistencia al conductor generalmente ya vienen incluidas de serie en la versión básica. Por ejemplo, el sistema de control de crucero automático no se desactiva con solo presionar suavemente el pedal de freno; solo se apaga cuando el conductor frena con más fuerza. De igual forma, la asistencia de mantenimiento de carril permanece activa incluso después de una pequeña señal de dirección del conductor.

El asistente de autopista mejorado apoya a los conductores del BMW iX3 desde el momento en que ingresan a la autopista hasta que la abandonan, permitiéndoles quitar las manos del volante durante largos períodos. La funcionalidad del Asistente Urbano incluye detección de semáforos, donde el auto se detiene automáticamente y vuelve a avanzar.

Nueva arquitectura electrónica con cuatro “supercerebros”. La arquitectura electrónica totalmente nueva comprende un total de cuatro unidades de alta performance conocidas como “supercerebros”. Comparten su potencia de procesamiento para la dinámica de conducción, conducción automatizada, infoentretenimiento y funciones básicas y de confort. También sientan las bases para una nueva arquitectura de software, que puede actualizarse continuamente y está diseñada para incorporar futuras actualizaciones de funciones, incluyendo características de IA.

El nuevo sistema nervioso digital consiste en un cableado dividido en cuatro zonas. Esto reduce el peso en un 30% en comparación con la tecnología utilizada anteriormente y permite reducir unos 600 metros de cableado. Otra novedad son los “sistemas inteligentes de fusibles electrónicos” (eFuses), que reemplazan los fusibles de seguridad tradicionales. Permiten modos de energía inteligentes para diferentes estados del vehículo, ayudando a mejorar la eficiencia general del coche.

Con sus cuatro supercerebros y plataformas de software altamente conectadas, el BMW iX3 es un vehículo verdaderamente definido por software y está excepcionalmente preparado para el futuro. Además, la nueva arquitectura electrónica sienta las bases para mejoras multifacéticas en la conectividad del BMW iX3 con la app My BMW. Este nuevo nivel de calidad en la integración ofrece nuevas experiencias y tiene un gran potencial para futuras innovaciones.

Enfoque integral de sostenibilidad dirigido a la circularidad y la reducción de CO₂e

BMW Group inició el desarrollo de su próxima generación de vehículos intensificando sus esfuerzos para implementar de manera sistemática los principios de “Diseño para la Circularidad” y reducir aún más las emisiones de CO₂e a lo largo de todo el ciclo de vida del producto. Por ello, se ha aplicado un enfoque de sostenibilidad integral en el nuevo BMW iX3.

Una variedad de medidas garantiza que la huella de carbono del producto del nuevo BMW iX3 50 xDrive, a lo largo de todo su ciclo de vida —basado en una distancia de 200,000 kilómetros (124,260 millas)— sea un 34% menor que la de su predecesor. Esto significa que, al cargarse con electricidad de la mezcla energética europea, tiene una huella de carbono del producto menor que un modelo de combustión interna (ICE) comparable después de aproximadamente 21,500 kilómetros (13,358 millas). Cuando se carga exclusivamente con electricidad de fuentes renovables, el BMW iX3 50 xDrive supera al modelo ICE comparable después de solo 17,500 kilómetros (10,873 millas, WLTP combinado), permitiendo a los clientes potencialmente obtener ventajas en CO₂e en menos de un año.

Alrededor de un tercio del nuevo BMW iX3 está fabricado con materias primas secundarias. Por ejemplo, el compartimento de almacenamiento bajo la tapa delantera y la cubierta del compartimento del motor están hechos con un 30%[4] de plástico marino reciclado. El material base del hilo para el textil del asiento Econeer, la moldura del techo (textil) y la alfombra del suelo está fabricado en un 100%[5] con PET reciclado. En cuanto al chasis del vehículo, se utiliza aluminio compuesto en un 80% de materias primas secundarias para los rodamientos giratorios y las mazas de rueda, mientras que los rined se funden en aluminio con un contenido del 70% de materias primas secundarias.

La huella de carbono total de la cadena de suministro del sistema de producción del BMW iX3 50 xDrive se ha reducido en un 35%. La producción y operaciones en BMW Group Planta Debrecen no utilizan combustibles fósiles en condiciones normales de operación. Además, gracias a la tecnología BMW eDrive de sexta generación y otras medidas BMW EfficientDynamics, el consumo de energía del nuevo BMW iX3 es un 20% menor que el del modelo predecesor (WLTP combinado).

El nuevo sitio web corporativo de BMW Group ofrece una visión general de los temas clave de la compañía y consolida diversos aspectos del camino hacia la Neue Klasse. Brinda información extensa sobre el desarrollo de la última generación de modelos, destaca hitos históricos de la Neue Klasse y presenta detalles sobre las tecnologías innovadoras del nuevo BMW iX3, disponibles aquí: Official BMW Group website (en) . Además, a partir del 6 de septiembre de 2025, se lanzará en el sitio web corporativo una serie documental de cuatro partes sobre la Neue Klasse, que ofrecerá una mirada profunda a la transformación significativa de la compañía.

# BMW Motorrad presents the new BMW R 1300 R.
## The BMW R 1300 R: The new dynamic roadster with boxer engine is significantly sportier, both technically and visually, delivering a more dynamic riding experience.
Date: 2025-04-10 | Author: Veronika Kluepfel BMW Group | ID: T0449378EN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“With the new BMW R 1300 R, we’ve taken our dynamic roadster with boxer engine to a whole new level. Focused uncompromisingly on riding dynamics, it delivers a far sportier experience than its predecessor thanks to a completely redesigned engine and chassis, while still retaining core BMW values such as touring capability and comfort." Christof Lischka, Head of Development BMW Motorrad

The new BMW R 1300 R: the new dynamic roadster with boxer engine is noticeably sportier both technically and visually, featuring dynamic styling for an aggressive, athletic design. Four attractive model variants.

The goal behind developing the new BMW R 1300 R was to achieve both a visual and technical enhancement of the dynamic roadster with boxer engine. Alongside its more aggressive, sportier design, equipment features such as the Performance variant – including a sport suspension, short hand levers, milled and adjustable footrests, DTC-Shift, two additional sport screens, sport seat, engine spoiler and sport tyres – allow customers to dial up the bike’s dynamic potential even further. At the same time, the BMW R 1300 R remains a capable companion for everyday use and touring, and with options such as seat heating, Riding Assistant, a windscreen, and a variety of luggage choices, the bike can be perfectly tailored to individual needs of this type.

The basic version of the BMW R 1300 R is offered in Snapper Rocks metallic, with additional variants including the Exclusive variant in Racing blue metallic, the sport-focused Performance variant in Lightwhite uni, and the premium [ADDRESS] Kilauea in Blackstorm metallic.

Sporty ergonomics and equipment for both dynamic riding fun and touring comfort.

The BMW Motorrad developers set out to make the new BMW R 1300 R significantly more dynamic and sporty than its predecessor – a goal the new dynamic roadster with boxer engine fulfils not only in terms of design, engine and chassis: equal importance was also placed on ergonomics, with a focus on creating a sportier, more active riding position.

Accordingly, the ergonomic triangle formed by handlebars, footrests and seat on the new BMW R 1300 R has been designed to position the rider noticeably further forward over the front wheel thanks to slightly rear-set footrests and flatter handlebars. This results in particular in improved feedback from the front end, especially during sporty riding, and therefore even greater controllability. At the same time, the sporty seating position still allows for relaxed touring and cruising, even with a passenger. Optional Comfort handlebars are also available.

A range of seat variants ensures an optimum seat height, while a newly developed luggage system with electrified cases and a clever tank bag makes the bike ideal for comfortable touring and holiday trips.

For many years, BMW’s roadsters with boxer engine have enjoyed an excellent reputation among female customers and restarters in particular. This is thanks to their good accessibility and low seat height. For this reason, the development of the new R 1300 R again placed particular focus on achieving a seat height of well below 790 mm. In addition to the standard seat, several others are available as individual items of optional equipment ex works.

For touring and holiday rides, the new BMW R 1300 R can be fitted with a newly developed case system and case holders from the BMW Motorrad Original Accessories range, or with preparation for the luggage system fitted as optional equipment ex works. The cases have a capacity of 26 and 29 litres respectively. Both are electrified and can be unlocked using the central locking system. They also both feature interior lighting, and the left-hand case includes a USB-C charging port. The tank bag is also new. For the first time, it is completely strapless and attaches to the bike via a tank ring.

Rugged boxer engine with top figures for power and torque along with optimised running smoothness and efficiency.

The boxer engine in the new BMW R 1300 R has a capacity of exactly 1 300 cc while the ratio between bore and stroke is 106.5 to 73 mm (predecessor: 102.5 to 76 mm). This increase in capacity derives from an enlarged cylinder bore and a new crankshaft with reduced stroke. It has an output of 107 kW (145 hp) (predecessor: 100 kW (136 hp), still at 7 750 rpm, and develops a maximum torque of 149 Nm at 6 500 rpm (predecessor: 143 Nm at 6 250 rpm), making it by far the most powerful serial production BMW boxer engine to date. Its maximum engine speed is 9 000 rpm.

Three riding modes are included as standard, allowing the bike to adapt ideally to any road conditions. Riding Modes Pro with the additional modes “Dynamic” and “Dynamic Pro”, along with riding mode pre-selection as optional equipment ex works. Engine drag torque control (MSR) as standard.

In standard trim, the new R 1300 R has three riding modes for adaptation to individual rider preferences. The “Rain” and “Road” riding modes allow riding characteristics to be adapted to most road conditions. The “Eco” riding mode also makes it possible to use the innovative BMW ShiftCam technology primarily in such a way that the maximum range can be achieved with a single tank of fuel. On request the new R 1300 R can also be fitted with the optional equipment item “Riding Modes Pro” ex works: among other things, this comprises the additional riding modes “Dynamic” and “Dynamic Pro”. With the riding mode pre-selection the rider can use the riding mode button to make an individual selection. In this way, a preferred and easily manageable number of riding modes can be configured and selected while riding.

Engine drag torque control (MSR) is on board even in standard trim. This can be used to safely avoid unstable riding conditions that can occur during coasting or downshifting due to excessive brake slip at the rear wheel. In these cases, MSR instantly opens the throttle valves to such an extent that drag torque is equalised and the motorcycle stabilises.

Automated shift assistant (ASA) with fully automated clutch operation and manual or automated shifting for an enhanced motorcycling experience as optional equipment.

With the automated shift assistant (ASA), BMW Motorrad offers an innovative technical solution to make motorcycling easier and more comfortable. True to the motto “Simplify your Ride”, automated clutch operation and gear changes puts the riding experience even more front and centre – without sacrificing the dynamic of the shifting process.

Completely newly developed chassis with sheet metal main frame made of steel and aluminium rear frame.

The chassis of the new BMW R 1300 R has been completely redesigned. The centrepiece is the new sheet metal main frame made of steel, which in addition to a significant optimisation of the installation space for even more compact packaging also offers higher levels of stiffness than the predecessor model. In the course of the redesign, the rear frame was also completely reconceived. In place of the previous tubular steel construction, the new R 1300 R now has a rear frame made of die-cast aluminium.

In combination with a drive unit that is now much more compact, the new design of the chassis achieved a significant concentration of mass towards the overall centre of gravity, which is reflected in noticeable handling benefits. At the same time, the new R 1300 R is even more precise and stable when braking, requires noticeably less effort to ride, and offers an even more satisfyingly precise response of the suspension elements.

New upside-down telescopic fork and revised EVO Paralever rear suspension for even greater handling precision. New wheels more than 1.4 kg lighter.

In the new BMW R 1300 R, front wheel guide is handled by a new upside-down telescopic fork with an inner tube diameter of 47 mm. The rear wheel guide of the new R 1300 R has also been redesigned. The hallmark of the Evo Paralever is a significantly stiffer connection via the suspension in the frame and a continuous swinging arm quick-release axle.

The new R 1300 R also features new 17-inch aluminium cast wheels with hollow-spoke design. All in all they weigh in at more than 1.4 kg less than the existing wheels. The reduced rotational masses result in both improved acceleration and brake response as well as optimised handling qualities.

New electronic Dynamic Suspension Adjustment (DSA), with dynamic adjustment of the damping, spring rate and load compensation as optional equipment. The world’s first series production motorcycle telescopic fork with adjustable spring rate.

With its dynamic adjustment of the damping and adjustable spring rest at the rear, the standard electronic Dynamic ESA itself offers a high level of riding safety and riding fun on a wide variety of terrains.

The electronic Dynamic Suspension Adjustment (DSA) now goes one step further, combining the dynamic adjustment of the front and rear damping with a corresponding adjustment of the spring rate (“spring stiffness”) – depending on the selected riding mode, riding condition and manoeuvres. This makes the new BMW R 1300 R the first series production motorcycle with an upside-down telescopic fork that allows adjustment of the spring rate. Automatic load compensation is provided by the adjustable spring rest. With DSA, the rider benefits from even more refined handling and increased banking freedom.

A high-performance braking system in conjunction with Integral ABS Pro comes as standard. Sport brake as optional equipment ex works.

The R 1300 R comes as standard with a twin disc brake featuring two radially mounted four-piston fixed callipers at the front and a single disc brake with two-piston floating calliper at the rear in conjunction with BMW Motorrad Integral ABS Pro. The new BMW R 1300 R can be fitted with the sport brake system as optional equipment ex works. In addition to a sportier look with titanium-coloured brake callipers, it offers a slight increase in braking performance.

Standard full LED headlight in dynamic octagonal design and state-of-the-art LED lighting throughout. Headlight Pro with adaptive turning light as optional equipment ex works.

BMW Motorrad is regarded as the pioneer par excellence when it comes to motorcycling safety and related innovations. Accordingly, the new R 1300 R comes as standard with a newly designed LED headlight in a dynamic octagonal shape, featuring a distinctive light icon.

With the optional Adaptive Turning Light, the dipped beam of the standard full LED headlight is optimised for cornering, depending on the banking position, by activating additional LED elements. In this way, the bend is almost fully illuminated because the light moves to where the motorcycle is heading. By optimising the light pattern, the dipped beam light ensures an even wider and more homogeneous illumination of the road.

Riding Assistant with Active Cruise Control (ACC) and Front Collision Warning (FCW) for safe and comfortable motorcycling as optional equipment ex works.

The new BMW R 1300 R can be equipped with the Riding Assistant for even safer and more comfortable motorcycling. This includes Active Cruise Control (ACC) and Front Collision Warning (FCW).

For the first time, navigation preparation now features electric unlocking for maximum operating comfort as optional equipment ex works.

This item of ex works optional equipment allows quick and secure attachment and operation of a navigation device or smartphone using a mount cradle. For the first time, this holder no longer requires a key – it unlocks electrically for maximum convenience.

Optional equipment and Original BMW Motorrad Accessories for the new BMW R 1300 R.

An extensive program of optional equipment and optional accessories is available for further customisation of the new BMW R 1300 R.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jerez de la Frontera. Misión cumplida: Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR) es nuevamente Campeón Mundial del Campeonato Mundial FIM Superbike (WorldSBK) 2025. Con un tercer lugar en la segunda carrera principal del dramático final de temporada en Jerez de la Frontera (ESP), “El Turco” aseguró la corona. Este es su segundo título mundial consecutivo como piloto oficial de BMW Motorrad Motorsport con la BMW M 1000 RR del equipo ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team, y el tercer título WorldSBK de su carrera (2021, 2024, 2025).

Después de su sobresaliente victoria en el campeonato de 2024, Razgatlioglu entró a la temporada 2025 como claro favorito. Sin embargo, tras una fase de pruebas invernales en la que la BMW M 1000 RR tuvo que adaptarse rápidamente debido a cambios en la normativa, la temporada comenzó siendo más desafiante de lo esperado. A pesar de conseguir un hat-trick en la segunda ronda en Portimão (POR), también hubo contratiempos, y Razgatlioglu se encontró en el rol de perseguidor detrás del piloto de Ducati Nicolò Bulega (ITA).

Pero a mediados de temporada, en junio, “El Turco”, BMW Motorrad Motorsport y el equipo ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK dieron la vuelta a la situación. En Misano (ITA), Donington Park (GBR), el nuevo circuito Balaton Park (HUN) y Magny-Cours (FRA), ganó todas las carreras, logrando cuatro hat-tricks consecutivos y tomando el liderato del campeonato. Luego celebró su primera victoria en MotorLand Aragón (ESP), igualando su propio récord de 13 victorias consecutivas de 2024. Tras más victorias y podios, aseguró finalmente el título 2025 con 616 puntos, 13 puntos por delante de Bulega.

Su compañero de equipo, Michael van der Mark (NED), cerró su última temporada como piloto WorldSBK con más fuertes resultados entre los 10 primeros. Tras cinco años con el equipo ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK (2021–2025), seguirá siendo parte de la familia BMW Motorrad Motorsport. Ya el martes en Jerez de la Frontera, regresará a la BMW M 1000 RR para trabajar con el equipo de pruebas BMW Motorrad WorldSBK en la preparación de la temporada 2026.

Reacciones tras la final de temporada:

Markus Flasch, CEO de BMW Motorrad: “¡Felicidades a Toprak y a todo el equipo! Esta temporada todos demostraron de qué están hechos los verdaderos campeones. Las primeras carreras no fueron fáciles, pero para todos –especialmente para Toprak– la actitud fue clara: levantarse, enderezar la corona y seguir adelante. ¡Y cómo siguieron adelante! La racha ganadora que comenzó en Misano fue simplemente impresionante. Incluso en el nervioso domingo final en Jerez, tras el desafortunado retiro en la carrera de Superpole sin culpa suya, todos se mantuvieron completamente enfocados y prepararon todo a la perfección para que Toprak sellara el título en la segunda carrera. La recompensa es el merecido segundo título mundial de Toprak en nuestra BMW M 1000 RR. Estamos increíblemente orgullosos de él y de todos en el equipo, en Múnich y Berlín, cuyo duro trabajo hizo posible este logro.”

Toprak Razgatlioglu, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “Estoy muy feliz y sonriente. Ganar el título fue muy importante para mí. Este fue mi último año con BMW y en el paddock de Superbike. Es un gran regalo para BMW antes de que me vaya a MotoGP. Al final somos campeones mundiales. Al principio de la temporada no éramos tan fuertes, pero mejoramos en cada carrera. Gracias a todo el equipo y a BMW por todo este duro trabajo. No soy yo el campeón mundial, somos nosotros. Mirando atrás a este fin de semana final: todo salió muy bien ayer especialmente y hoy llegué a la pista más relajado. Solo necesitaba terminar la carrera de Superpole dentro de los siete primeros, pero nos caímos en la curva cinco. Sé que así es el motociclismo y todos quieren pasar. Él (Nicolò Bulega) me golpeó y me caí. Después de eso me mantuve tranquilo y enfocado en la segunda carrera porque necesitaba hacer un buen trabajo. Me concentré en lograr la mejor posición posible. Empecé la carrera sin presionar demasiado, pero fui avanzando paso a paso y al final estuvimos en el podio. Ser Campeón Mundial otra vez es una gran sensación y quiero agradecer a todos los que formaron parte de este viaje.”

Sven Blusch, jefe de BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “Estoy muy feliz y sin palabras. Es un día increíble. Creo que después de la carrera de Superpole todos envejecimos diez años. El trabajo que hizo el equipo fue increíble. La moto estaba bastante dañada y trabajar bajo tanta presión para tenerla lista para la segunda carrera fue impresionante. Todos se mantuvieron tranquilos, y creo que eso fue la clave para ganar el título. El segundo título consecutivo: estamos felices por Toprak, por el equipo, por BMW Motorrad. Toprak hizo historia para BMW. Fue un viaje intenso y estamos tristes que haya terminado, pero lo apoyaremos el próximo año. También estamos muy agradecidos por todo lo que Mickey ha hecho por nosotros. Hemos tenido años difíciles, también con lesiones, pero siempre fue leal. Y ha sido una parte importante para ganar estos dos títulos. Estamos deseando seguir trabajando con él. Pronto anunciaremos lo que haremos. Pero por ahora, vamos a celebrar esta noche, y a partir de mañana nos enfocaremos completamente en la temporada 2026 con Danilo Petrucci y Miguel Oliveira.”

Christian Gonschor, director técnico de BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “No puedo describir cómo me siento porque fue un día increíble. Unas horas con muchas emociones, altibajos, todo pasó. Pero al final ver a Toprak de nuevo en el podio, celebrando el segundo título mundial para nosotros, para BMW, me llena de orgullo a mí y a todo el proyecto, al equipo y a todos los involucrados. Es un día fantástico para cerrar algo fantástico. Al final, la clave para cualquier éxito en el deporte es siempre el enfoque y el trabajo en equipo. Escuchamos a los pilotos, analizamos nuestro paquete e intentamos enfocarnos para aprender cuando no éramos lo suficientemente rápidos para vencer a nuestros competidores. Y con el enfoque de los pilotos, el equipo y todos nuestros técnicos en Múnich, logramos dar vuelta a la página. Gracias a Toprak, que es una persona increíble dentro y fuera de la pista, gracias a Mickey, que hizo mucho por nosotros desde que llegó en 2021, y gracias a todo el equipo. Un agradecimiento muy personal también para mi esposa Katharina y mis hijos, que siempre son mi apoyo.”

Shaun Muir, director del equipo ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “Es difícil poner en palabras lo que siento. Despertamos muy, muy positivos, pero como siempre sabemos, en las carreras puede pasar cualquier cosa, y así fue en la carrera sprint. Solo puedo juntar mis manos y elogiar el gran trabajo que hicieron los chicos. Todo el equipo se mantuvo enfocado. Al final, Toprak es tricampeón mundial, y dos veces con BMW. Estoy absolutamente feliz, orgulloso de todos los involucrados y de todo el arduo trabajo que hicieron.”

Michael van der Mark, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “Ha sido un buen fin de semana. Tengo sentimientos encontrados sobre mis carreras, especialmente la segunda, que no disfruté tanto como hubiera querido. Pero sabes, esto es motociclismo y creo que después de hoy tenemos muchas razones para estar felices con el equipo. Ha sido una temporada extraña. El inicio fue raro con cambios de última hora en la reglamentación y cosas así. Especialmente para mí, tuve muchas dificultades con la moto, honestamente. También mentalmente fue difícil en un momento y no lograba avanzar. Eso fue duro. Pero siempre seguimos trabajando, el equipo siempre trabajó y creo que hacia el final del año hice las 8 Horas de Suzuka, recuperé la confianza y cuando regresé tuve la velocidad otra vez y me sentí más seguro con la moto. Creo que Toprak mostró otra vez lo especial que es y se merece el título. Él y todo el equipo se lo merecen. El tiempo pasó rápido y disfruté mi tiempo en WorldSBK. Tengo seis victorias y podios aquí. Ahora tengo exactamente un día libre y el martes comenzaré con el equipo de pruebas para mejorar el paquete para el próximo año para Danilo y Miguel.”

# Turning Vision into Reality: the new BMW iX3 – the first Neue Klasse model drives product sustainability.
## Sustainability along the entire life cycle +++ Neue Klasse offers a comprehensive sustainability approach in supply chain, production and use phase measures +++ Focus on decarbonization and resource conservation +++
Date: 2025-08-04 | Author: Cornelia Bovensiepen BMW Group | ID: T0451547EN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Munich. The new BMW iX3 demonstrates the BMW Group's take on implementing a holistic approach to product sustainability across the entire life cycle. During product development, extensive measures were implemented throughout the supply chain, production and use phases, explicitly focused on conserving resources and reducing the model’s environmental footprint. As such, the Neue Klasse marks an important milestone toward achieving the company's 2030 and 2050 CO₂e targets. CO₂e benefits achievable after only one year of use The extensive decarbonization measures in the supply chain results in an early break-even point: when charged with electricity from the European energy mix, the CO₂e footprint of the new BMW iX3 50 xDrive is lower than that of a comparable model with a combustion engine after about 21,500 kilometers (WLTP combined). When charged exclusively with electricity from renewable sources, the BMW iX3 50 xDrive beats the comparable ICE model after only 17,500 kilometers (WLTP combined), allowing customers to potentially achieve CO₂e benefits in as little as one year. Decarbonization in the supply chain The key levers to reduce CO₂e emissions in the supply chain are the use of secondary materials and renewable energy, alongside product and process innovations. This combination of measures has led to a decrease of CO₂e emissions in the supply chain of 35% during product development. The Gen6 battery cells of the BMW iX3 high-voltage storage system are made of 50% secondary cobalt, lithium, and nickel materials. In addition, renewable energies are harnessed in the anode and cathode materials and cell production. This is how CO₂e emissions per watt hour were reduced by 42% compared to the Gen5 cell of the previous model.

The BMW Group is increasingly focused on the use of innovative and secondary materials in other components as well. For instance, 30% of the secondary raw material used for the engine compartment cover and the storage compartment under the front hatch is recycled maritime plastic. This post-consumer material consists of old fishing nets and ropes, preventing these materials from potentially being dumped in the ocean. Secondary aluminum accounts for 80% of the wheel carriers and swivel bearings as well as 70% of the cast aluminum wheels. ‘Design for Circularity’: consistent implementation in the Neue Klasse The BMW Group applied the ‘Design for Circularity’ approach consistently in developing the BMW iX3. The approach builds on the concepts of secondary first (the prioritized use of secondary materials), strategic material selection and disassembly optimization. As a result, secondary materials account for one third of all material used in the new BMW iX3 50 xDrive. One example of implementing these three concepts is the Econeer seat cover, available in the interior trim Essential, whose fabric, adhesive and fleece are all made from PET. This mono-material choice increases recyclability. Moreover, the textile yarn used consists entirely of recycled PET as well. Other components whose development followed the ‘Design for Circularity’ approach include the center console, instrument panel and interior floor trim. Significantly improved efficiency in the use phase BMW EfficientDynamics involves consistently identifying and harnessing efficiency potential in all vehicle subsystems. Applying this approach, the energy consumption of the new BMW iX3 is 20% lower than in the predecessor model (WLTP combined). This significant improvement is primarily based on optimized aerodynamic properties, reduced rolling resistance and on-board power consumption as well as the drive’s unparalleled combination of efficiency and dynamics. Sustainability-centric production at BMW Group’s Debrecen plant Designed and built according to the BMW iFactory principles, the new BMW Group plant in Debrecen, Hungary, is fully focused on efficiency, digitalization and sustainability. It is the first BMW Group car factory that is operated and produces vehicles without using fossil fuels, such as oil and gas, under normal operating conditions. The only energy source to power operations at the site is electricity. According to current planning, up to 25% of the plant's annual electricity needs can be covered by the photovoltaic system located on the premises. The remaining electricity is obtained from other renewable energy sources. Surplus solar energy is stored in a heat storage unit and used to heat the paint shop ovens as needed. [ADDRESS].1 tons of CO₂e are emitted in the production of a BMW iX3 car, about two third below production at other BMW Group plants. The BMW Group’s sustainability targets The BMW Group's commitment to the Paris Climate Agreement and to achieving Net Zero by 2050 or earlier is an integral part of the comprehensive 360° sustainability approach incorporated in the corporate strategy. The company is pursuing ambitious, scientifically derived CO₂e targets for the coming years.

If a brand is to succeed, it needs loyal customers who’ll stick with the brand for years if not decades, and who’ll keep buying its cars even as their needs and circumstances change. Those customers are usually found within the membership rolls of its affiliated club, the size of which is a good indicator of a brand’s strength overall.

The creation of BMW’s first North American clubs was sparked by a groundswell of enthusiasm for the [ADDRESS] two-doors: the 1600-2 and 2002 that debuted in 1966 and 1968, respectively. By the spring of 1969, enthusiasts of those cars had formed the BMW Car Club of America in Boston, Massachusetts, the Stanford BMW Club in Palo Alto, California, the Kansas City BMW Club, another in Dayton, Ohio and others. The clubs grew quickly, and more were formed around the country as BMW owners sought out like-minded enthusiasts of these little-known German imports.

It wasn’t long before the Boston club founded by Bob Mehrman and Michel Potheau became the de facto nationwide organization for BMW enthusiasts, thanks to a strong response to ads placed in magazines like Road & Track and Car and Driver —which had jump-started the 2002 craze in April 1968 with David E. Davis’s “Turn Your Hymnals to 2002”. With the BMW CCA ascendant, smaller clubs became affiliated chapters of the larger organization.

Over the weekend of [ADDRESS]-11, 1970, the BMW CCA began a 50-year tradition when it staged its first “Oktoberfest” at the Colonial Inn in Concord, Massachusetts. The event included tech sessions, an autocross, a road rally, and a concours d’elegance. For the next half-century, CCA chapters would stage Oktoberfests across the U.S., giving members an excuse to drive their BMWs far and wide.

Early CCA member Michael Izor drove his 2002 from Boston to the first Oktoberfest in Concord, and to everyone that followed for the next 49 years. “The next year, it moved to Washington, DC, and I’d never been there. The year after that, Virginia Beach, and I’d never been there, either,” Izor said. “Year after year, Oktoberfest got me to see this country like I never would have otherwise, in a car that I absolutely adored.”

In 1970, the BMW CCA gained a friendly rival in the BMW Automobile Club of America, founded by 2002-obsessed enthusiasts in Los Angeles. Though smaller than the CCA, and with only a handful of chapters on the West Coast, the ACA had a distinct advantage over the CCA: official recognition by BMW importer Max Hoffman.

The CCA had formed without Hoffman’s consent, and its relationship with Hoffman was antagonistic. By contrast, Leif Anderberg had sought out Hoffman’s cooperation when founding the ACA, and he got it. Anderberg hailed from Sweden, and his European origins—along with those of German-born Mike Dietel, another early member—might have smoothed the relationship. In any case, Hoffman’s endorsement facilitated the ACA’s recognition by the International Council of BMW Clubs in Munich, and the participation of ACA members in BMW’s driving schools at the Nürburgring from 1974 to 2002.

Even so, the ACA never became a truly national organization, and plenty of BMW enthusiasts within its geographical reach joined the CCA instead. When BMW of North America took over from Max Hoffman in 1975, the new corporation was determined to unify the clubs into a single entity. That task fell to Tom McGurn and Carla Harman of BMW NA’s Corporate Communications Department, but they wouldn’t succeed until 1997, when the Los Angeles chapter finally merged with the CCA. (The last of the ACA chapters wasn’t absorbed until 2000, when the Puget Sound ACA chapter switched its allegiance to the CCA.)

With that, 71,000 BMW enthusiasts nationwide became a unified club: the BMW Car Club of America. It was reportedly the largest single-marque car club in the world, which it remains to this date even though membership has dropped to approximately 65,000. That’s still an impressive figure for a club that emphasizes real-life activities when so much of our lives take place online.

A crucial factor in keeping the CCA relevant to its membership is a strong relationship with BMW of North America. That wasn’t necessarily the case when BMW NA took over from Hoffman in 1975, Harman said. “A lot of the people at BMW NA had come from other industries, and they couldn’t fathom why people would come together to form a club over cars.”

Harman did, and she succeeded in fostering a closer relationship between BMW NA and both U.S. clubs. “It was an adversarial relationship in 1975, but by 1980 it was more like an uneasy friendship. As the ’80s progressed, it was well on the way to developing into a mutually supportive relationship,” she said. “I spent a lot of time going to events and meetings to see what they needed, and I was able to increase BMW’s support quite a bit. It took almost 20 years for the BMW NA Marketing Department to see the benefit, but about when I left in 1992 the club responsibility was handed to Marketing, and they really went to town.”

Indeed, 1992 marked a sea change within BMW. Victor Doolan arrived from BMW Canada as Head of Sales, then as President, bringing an intense product focus and a determination to restore BMW’s appeal to enthusiasts. In 1994, Doolan hired longtime CCA member Rich Brekus to lead product planning and strategy. Brekus knew that the club was home to BMW’s most loyal customers, and so did Erik Wensberg, who worked under Brekus as BMW NA’s Motorsport and (from 1995) M Brand Manager.

“Erik did a great job in building the relationship with the car club,” Brekus said. “A lot of people within NA thought club members were driving 2002s and smoking a pipe, but we knew they bought a ton of M cars, lots of options, and big engines. They’re by far our most profitable customers.”

As BMW NA’s club liaison, Wensberg worked with BMW CCA Executive Director Mark Luckman and President Paul Johnson to promote the club with BMW NA customers. “We asked our friends at the vehicle prep centers to put a club solicitation in the glove box of each car,” Wensberg said. “That got us thinking that the more the club succeeds, the more we’ll succeed. A few years later, that led to the first purchase incentive program. We were already spending a king’s ransom to offer low-cost financing or lease rates, and I told Doolan that we should be doing this for our most devoted fans who buy multiple cars. Doolan grasped it immediately, and we developed the first sales incentive for club members in 1995 or ’96.”

That was happening just as the U.S.-spec E36 M3 was arriving on these shores, spurred by a letter-writing campaign inspired by BMW CCA Roundel columnist Bob Roemer, among others. The club’s role in making that car a reality—as well as a huge success—saw Wensberg affix “BMW CCA” stickers on the rear wing and front bumper of every M3 raced by BMW NA in IMSA GT.

“Our point from the very first race was that this racing program was for the club,” Wensberg said. “And at the races, we invited club members into the pits, introduced them to the drivers, let them ask questions, get autographs and hats, etc. We wanted the team to be as inclusionary as possible with the club. Everywhere we went we had a terrific fan base, and the dealers were selling all the M3s they could get their hands on.”

After Wensberg left BMW NA in 1999, Larry Koch took over as Motorsport Manager and Club Liaison; he’d later serve as M Brand Manager, as well. Though club engagement constituted to be only a small portion of his responsibilities, he made considerable effort to strengthen the relationship between BMW NA and the CCA. Like Wensberg, he invited club members to IMSA races, adding entertaining and informative paddock tours that highlighted racing history. He also restored BMW NA’s historic race cars to active duty, giving rides to raise money for the BMW CCA Foundation, as BMW Classic USA continues to do today.

Koch helped the CCA draft a forward-thinking mission statement and fostering the final rapprochement between the CCA and the remaining ACA chapters, as well as the CCA’s relationship with the International Council. He supported events like Gateway Tech and Oktoberfest, as well as the club’s presence at the Monterey Historic Races and Lime Rock Vintage Festival. “I also worked hard to bring the CCA to BMW NA-sponsored events like the M Power Tours, 3 Across America, etc.,” Koch said. “It enhanced BMW’s exposure while providing a lot of fun for club members.”

To enhance BMW NA’s connection to the vintage community, Koch worked with Goetz Pfafflin to establish the BMW Classic Car Club of America. “It’s a small group, but if an event brings out 40 vintage cars, there’s a big benefit at very little cost,” Koch said. “BMW’s heritage was the third most popular reason people buy BMWs instead of another brand, and people who own antique BMWs have an 85 percent chance of owning a newer BMW. The guy who owns an M1 or 2002 also has an X5 or 5 Series.”

Koch also facilitated the sale of classic car parts through BMW dealers, keeping that business in-house rather than sending customers to third parties.

When the BMW CCA needed larger offices, the high price of Boston real estate made a local expansion prohibitively expensive. After considering other cities, the club—then led by Executive Director Wynne Smith and President Phil Marx—settled on Greenville, South Carolina, which placed the club in close proximity to BMW Manufacturing and the BMW Performance Center, which began hosting new-car deliveries and driver training programs in 1999.

The CCA held its annual Oktoberfest in Greenville in 2000, then opened its new office downtown in 2001. The BMW CCA Foundation established itself in Greenville two years later, then opened its museum and archive in nearby Greer in 2013. On the CCA’s 50th anniversary in 2019, the club moved into a spacious new campus just down the highway, which it shares with the BMW Motorcycle Owner’s Association (BMW MOA).

Following Koch’s retirement at the end of 2012, the club liaison position at BMW NA returned to the Corporate Communications Department. Head of BMW Group Product Communications Tom Plucinsky served as lead liaison, with his entire team engaged with the club, as well. For lifelong BMW enthusiast Matt Russell, serving as club liaison was “one of the greatest honors of my career.”

Russell put his MBA to work quantifying the club’s contribution to BMW NA’s success, and he arrived at some interesting conclusions. “One of the greatest challenges in business is to quantify why one customer can mean more to a brand's success than another... beyond the rather blind metric of transaction price,” Russell said. Once we grasped the activity level multiplied by the scale of the BMW CCA, we began to appreciate what a driving force the club members were in the overall growth of our brand.”

That effect has been magnified by the rise of social media, but it predates that phenomenon by decades, Russell said. “Club members were ‘influencers’ before modern influencers were even born: They’re the experts in their communities when it comes to car shopping, the ones approached for advice when ‘non-car people’ or ‘near-car people’ are considering their next car. Club members almost always recommend a BMW car or SAV, and no other luxury carmaker has a club like the BMW CCA or a relationship with the club like BMW NA does. When you’re competing with Lexus or Mercedes-Benz, or working hard to maintain your sales lead over Audi as we were, an advantage like the magic of the BMW CCA cannot be overestimated.”

Today, the club liaison post is handled enthusiastically by Plucinsky, now Head of BMW Classic USA. Like his predecessors, Plucinsky has provided strong support for the club’s activities, as well as those of the BMW CCA Foundation. That support has been financial, of course, but it has also included material support: loaning cars from the BMW Classic USA collection to exhibits at the Foundation Museum, and previewing new models at club events like Legends of the bahn in Monterey, which helps to make those events more alluring.

Crucially, Plucinsky helped the club survive the Covid pandemic by enhancing the new-car rebate program at a crucial time.

However, despite those inducements, the pandemic accelerated trends that have affected clubs of all types in the 21st century. Volunteerism has declined, leading to cutbacks in BMW CCA activities. “We used to have a driving school on any given weekend in California, for instance,” Patek said. “This year, there will be one driving school in the entire state. As we move forward, we’re going to have to rely less on volunteers and more on staff or contractors to organize events. Where driving schools are concerned, we have to figure out whether to morph away from having an instructor in every car or holding the line on what we’ve always believed in.”

The club’s print magazines have been hit by rising costs for paper and postage, forcing a reduction of issues from monthly to bi-monthly while the remainder of content is provided online. The club’s weeklong Oktoberfest—now O’Fest Forever—has become a biannual event, supplemented by weekend events that give members a chance to connect with their friends in the club without needing to take an entire week off work, or to travel such long distances to do so.

Those connections represent the club’s true value in 2025, as they have since 1969. “We like to say that the brand brought us together, but the friends we make within the club are what keep us here,” Patek said. “The people in this club are really kindhearted and generous of spirit, and that remains a constant.”

For BMW of North America, having a large and active club has been a consistent factor in its own success. BMW CCA members remain its most loyal customers, as well as the strongest ambassadors a brand could hope for. “BMW CCA members are wonderful people, they love the brand and they purchase many vehicles each year. For all of that, we at BMW NA, thank you!” Plucinsky said.

# The BMW Group at Auto Shanghai 2025.
## +++ The road to Neue Klasse: BMW presents technology highlights of the next vehicle generations +++ First Neue Klasse model for China arrives in 2026 +++ BMW shows BMW Panoramic iDrive as a stand-alone version for the Chinese market and test vehicle BMW Vision Driving Experience with Heart of Joy and luminescent paintwork +++ MINI presents the new high-performance models from MINI John Cooper Works +++

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Munich/Shanghai. On the road to Neue Klasse, the BMW Group will be showcasing the outstanding innovations of future vehicle generations at Auto Shanghai 2025. "Innovative strength, a pioneering spirit and sheer driving pleasure - these characteristics are deeply rooted in BMW's DNA," says [EXECUTIVE_OFFICER], Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG. "In the Neue Klasse, they can be experienced by our customers on a whole new level: the user interface is even more intuitive, the design even more progressive and the driving experience even more precise and dynamic. By the end of this year, we will be putting the mobility of the future on the road".

The smart display and operating concept BMW Panoramic iDrive and the lightning-fast Heart of Joy central computer take centre stage at the auto show.

By the end of the year, the iX3 will be the first Neue Klasse model to roll off the production line at the new plant in Debrecen (Hungary). There will be a separate version for China in 2026, following the "At Home in China" strategy: The Shanghai design team is responsible for all China-specific models of the NEUE KLASSE, which will be produced at the Shenyang plant.

The BMW Vision Driving Experience is presented to the public for the first time in Shanghai: It is a high-performance test vehicle with no connection to series production, which BMW has designed as a rolling laboratory for optimising the Heart of Joy drive and driving dynamics control system. "The BMW Vision Driving Experience is equipped with the “Heart of Joy” – one of four super brains specifically developed for our software-defined Neue Klasse models," says [EXECUTIVE_OFFICER], member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, responsible for Customers, Brands and Sales. "The Heart of Joy takes every aspect of sheer driving pleasure to the next level. Starting with the launch of the first Neue Klasse model, the “Heart of Joy” will beat in every all-electric BMW model".

The four super brains combine the computing power for the most important customer functions: infotainment, automated driving, basic functions and driving dynamics. In this new, zonal electronics architecture, the Heart of Joy is responsible for drive, braking, charging, recuperation and partial steering functions. In conjunction with the BMW Dynamic Performance Control software, the system, which was developed entirely in-house, calculates all driving dynamics functions. It processes information ten times faster than previous systems and achieves latencies in the millisecond range. There will be control units with comparable functions for combustion engines and hybrids.

As the "world's fastest test rig", the BMW Vision Driving Experience takes the Heart of Joy and BMW Dynamic Performance Control to their absolute limits. With a maximum torque of 18,000 Newton metres and active aerodynamics, it generates 1.2 tonnes of downforce and lateral forces of up to 3G - a dimension on par with [ADDRESS] and far beyond the requirements of conventional vehicles in road traffic. The logic behind this: If the hardware and software can tame the brute forces of this test rig, they can easily cope with the demands of everyday use.

In Shanghai, the BMW Vision Driving Experience shines in an innovative, fluorescent paint finish. The paint's special light-sensitive pigments recharge in daylight, with even the smallest amount of ambient light sufficient. In the dark, the colour varies from a whitish yellow to an expressive neon yellow, depending on the state of charge. In addition, the rear of the car has been fitted with a "magic film" which, when stimulated by UV light, creates an expressive gradient from yellow to orange to pink from the rear to the front of the car. These special looks underline the uniqueness and innovative power of the car. Like the vision vehicle, they are not intended for series production.

The BMW Panoramic iDrive display and operating concept will revolutionise interaction with the vehicle in all new BMW series models from the launch of the Neue Klasse. In Shanghai, it can be seen in a stand-alone version that will be available in BMW models on the Chinese market from mid-2026. The core elements of the innovative concept are the new BMW Panoramic Vision - a head-up display that projects content across the entire width of the windscreen - and the BMW Operating System X. [ADDRESS]% of the software in the Chinese version consists of locally developed and adapted source code.

The system offers a wide range of exclusive digital functions, including the AI-based BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant for China. For example, the Large Language Model (LLM), which is integrated in the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant, is the result of a collaboration with Chinese technology pioneer Alibaba. Over the course of the year, the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant* will gradually be enhanced with "AI Reasoning by Deepseek" for a seamless connection between the vehicle and the outside world.

China is of outstanding importance for innovation, including in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). This is why the BMW Group is strengthening its partnerships with Chinese technology leaders as part of its 360° AI strategy. For BMW, "China for China" also means independent software development in the country where the BMW Group has its largest research and development centre outside Germany.

The MINI brand is showcasing the new John Cooper Works** model generation at the motor show. At the same time, MINI is paying tribute to the brand's racing history. On display in the highlight area, for example, is a classic Mini that competed in the legendary Monte Carlo Rally, as well as the MINI John Cooper Works Pro, which won the legendary 24-hour race at the Nürburgring last year. The other models of the new MINI family** complete the picture: The MINI Cooper Convertible, which celebrates its market launch in China at Auto Shanghai, as well as the MINI [ADDRESS] door, MINI [ADDRESS] door and MINI Aceman.

The Auto Shanghai at the National Exhibition and Convention Center has become the largest auto show in the world. More than one million visitors are expected from [ADDRESS] to [ADDRESS], 2025. Across almost 5,000 square meters, the BMW Group presents the latest products of the BMW and MINI brands. An oversized installation of the complete BMW Panoramic iDrive display and control system is the focus of the exhibition space. The road to Neue Klasse leads guests along a "road" across the exhibition. On display will be a BMW 1500, the historical model of the Neue Klasse from the 1960s, as well as the visionary vehicles BMW Vision Neue Klasse and BMW Vision Neue Klasse X. The BMW Group will showcase a total of 42 vehicles at its largest exhibition booth in the world.

China premiere of the BMW 3 [ADDRESS] Years Edition**: Five decades of driving pleasure - the world's most successful premium car in a special anniversary edition. To mark the occasion in China, BMW is launching an exclusive special edition – the BMW 3 [ADDRESS] Years Edition, limited to 2,500 units. Highlights include new paintwork, high-quality seat upholstery, specially designed 19-inch light-alloy wheels, carbon-fibre interior trim and a sports steering wheel with Alcantara trim and red 12 o'clock marker. These features combine to create a dynamic, stylish and personalised version of the iconic BMW 3 Series - offering customers in China an impressive combination of tradition and innovation.

World premiere BMW M4 Edition Nürburgring**: BMW M celebrates more than 25 years of cooperation with the Nürburgring with the exclusive special edition BMW M4 Edition Nürburgring. This special edition vehicle, which is only available in China, is limited to just 53 units to mark the 53rd anniversary of BMW M. Specific design elements make reference to the world's most famous racetrack. The BMW Individual Frozen Deep Green metallic paint finish is a nod to the "Green Hell". The red Nürburgring Nordschleife logo is embroidered on the headrests and the frameless radiator grille is also framed in this striking red. The uniform "nürburgring 1/53" lettering in the door sills symbolises that the vehicle is part of an exclusive special edition. The edition based on the BMW M4 Competition with M xDrive has the familiar in-line six-cylinder engine with M TwinPower Turbo technology and generates 390 kW/530 hp. This not only enables acceleration from 0 to 100 km/h (60 mph) in 3.5 seconds or 3.2 seconds according to the "1-foot rollout" method***, but also highly dynamic driving on the racetrack - tried and tested on the Nürburgring-Nordschleife, of course.

BMW M235L Gran Coupé**: Luxury and sportiness are standard in the BMW M235L Gran Coupé, the second M Performance model to be produced in China and the first Gran Coupé from the plant in Shenyang. The vehicle has BMW's most powerful 2.0T four-cylinder engine, which was tuned by BMW M and delivers a peak output of 221 kW. In combination with a 7-speed DCT transmission, it accelerates the vehicle from 0 to 100 km/h (60 mph) in five seconds. M exclusive digital functions and design elements enhance the driving pleasure and sporty atmosphere. The new model's wheelbase has been extended by 110 millimetres for more rear legroom and the perfect combination of sporty driving pleasure and comfort.

Sensational designs: In Shanghai, BMW presents Art Car #20, designed by US artist Julie Mehretu and based on the BMW M Hybrid V8 racing car. Magical colour changes: The BMW i5 Flow NOSTOKANA combines the technology of changing exterior colours developed by BMW with the artistic language of South African artist Esther Mahlangu. BMW is also presenting the design study BMW Concept Skytop Roadster.

* For BMW 5 Series and BMW X3 vehicles in China (with long wheelbase or long-wheelbase) from Q3/2025.

# Update for the Dingolfing Electric Pioneer
## +++ Model update of the BMW iX celebrates production start in Dingolfing +++ Electric SAV with up to 701 kilometers of range, more power and enhanced sportiness +++
Date: 2025-03-07 | Author: Sarah Koehler BMW Group | ID: T0448400EN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dingolfing. Today, the model update of the all-electric BMW iX celebrated its start of production at the BMW Group plant in Dingolfing. The electric pioneer, which has been manufactured at the site since 2021 and has since been sold over 130,000 units worldwide, receives a comprehensive update in March 2025 - offering increased performance, range and sportiness.

BMW's longest-range electric model.

The new BMW iX impresses with up to 25% higher drive power, significantly improved efficiency and a range of up to 701 kilometers in the WLTP cycle (BMW iX xDrive60: WLTP combined (EnVKV): Energy consumption 21.9 kWh/100 km; CO2 emissions 0 g/km; CO2 class A). The BMW iX is thus the most long-range electric model in the BMW Group's portfolio and the company's most important all-electric new model in 2025 - before the "New Class" makes its debut at the end of the year.

The new BMW iX also presents a more dynamic design than ever before: The vehicle is now available with the M Sport package and M Sport Pro package for the first time, which enhance the sporty appearance both inside and out. New exterior colours such as Arctic Race Blue metallic, Dune Grey metallic, Carbon Black metallic, BMW Individual Frozen Deep Grey metallic, BMW Individual Frozen Pure Grey metallic, Tanzanite Blue metallic and Space Silver are also offered.

Pioneering the All-Electric Era in Dingolfing.

Plant Manager Christoph Schröder states: "The BMW iX is a special vehicle for us. Four years ago, at its launch, it paved the way for many future technologies here on-site. And: It marked the beginning of the all-electric vehicle era in our plant." Meanwhile, a total of four electric models - the BMW iX, the BMW i7, and the all-electric versions of the 5 Series sedan and Touring - are being produced at the Lower Bavarian site, along with five plug-in hybrids. The BMW iX plays a crucial role in the model program of the entire company in the segment of all-electric mid-size and upper-class SAVs.

# BMW Group’s home plant gears up for NEUE KLASSE
## +++ Pre-series production to begin this summer +++ Lower manufacturing costs for NEUE KLASSE +++ Production Head Nedeljković: “Production network's strategic and flexible structure strengthens resilience and competitiveness” +++ Over one million cars built in Germany in 2024 +++

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Munich. BMW Group Plant Munich is gearing up to launch the NEUE KLASSE in summer 2026. During ongoing series operation, three new production halls are currently being built for the body shop, assembly and associated production logistics. “For the production start of the NEUE KLASSE, we will have a state-of-the-art plant in Munich that is characterised by flexibility, innovation and, above all, efficiency,” says Plant Director Peter Weber.

Starting in 2027, the plant in Munich will exclusively produce fully-electric vehicles, further enhancing efficiency boost. Forward planning, close cooperation with development teams and suppliers, and the integration of modern production technology within new structures will all play a key role. “With the NEUE KLASSE, we will significantly reduce manufacturing costs at the Munich Plant,” says Weber. In addition to optimised production processes and targeted automation, the NEUE KLASSE’s new vehicle architecture will also leverage further efficiencies. Focusing on a single drive train variant reduces production steps and the number of parts – for example, for wiring harnesses, which previously varied according to engine type and can be complex to install.

Unusual process: Pre-series production at pilot plant The timeline for the ramp-up in Munich is carefully synchronised – in part due to the plant’s refurbishment. The first pre-series vehicles will be built at the pilot plant of the BMW Group Research and Innovation Centre (FIZ), with support from Plant Munich’s production team, before the end of the year. “Alongside the pilot plant at the FIZ, we are also using virtual simulations to ensure a smooth ramp-up,” says Weber, describing the unusual situation in the decisive year ahead of the launch. He adds that Plant Munich’s experienced launch team is also working closely with colleagues at the new plant in Debrecen, Hungary, where the first NEUE KLASSE model will enter production late this year.

International production network: Cooperation, flexibility and innovative processes BMW Group plants are capable of producing different model variants and drive train types on a single line. Since the ramp-up of electromobility is not linear and will progress at varying speeds, the company has relied on “flex-plants”, which can manufacture vehicles with both internal combustion engines and electric drive trains. “In this way, we can ensure our delivery capabilities in different market situations and maintain good capacity utilisation at our locations,” explains Milan Nedeljković, member of the Board of Management responsible for Production.

By the end of the decade, the BMW Group expects a significant increase in the market shares of fully-electric vehicles. For this reason, the plants in Debrecen and, later, Munich will be the first facilities dedicated exclusively to fully-electric vehicles, enhancing electrification capacities throughout the network.

The German plants lead the way on e-mobility in the BMW Group’s production network: Alongside traditional drive technologies, each of them builds at least one fully-electric model for the global market. Even in a volatile environment, the BMW Group continues to grow its domestic locations, manufacturing over a million vehicles there last year – accounting for a quarter of Germany's total automotive production.

At the same time, the company’s production also depends on a balanced global distribution of value creation. “The strategic and flexible structure of our production network strengthens our resilience and makes us more competitive,” adds Nedeljković.

Focus on employees: Developing skills for e-mobility The shift towards electrified vehicles also brings changes to employee roles and required skills. With the flexible ramp-up of e-mobility at BMW Group plants, employees can gradually be prepared for new job content.

“Despite technical and structural innovations, our focus is always on people. We take pride in our employees’ expertise and experience, and their dedication to continuous improvement. It is thanks to their commitment that we are able to consistently deliver premium-quality vehicles,” emphasises Weber. Additional expertise will be developed and retained at the company through extensive further training and workforce flexibility. Last year alone, nearly 25,000 employees completed e-mobility training. Plant Munich is currently holding its third industrial electrician qualification course, conducted in cooperation with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK).

In recent years, around 5,500 jobs have been created across the BMW Group production network for the current and upcoming generation of e-drives. More than three quarters of these positions were filled through internal reorganisation.

# Thrilling victory at Aragón.
## +++ 13th consecutive win: Toprak Razgatlioglu ties his own WorldSBK record on the BMW M 1000 RR on Saturday. +++ Two second-place finishes for the championship leader from the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team on Sunday. +++ Michael van der Mark also shows strong race pace at Aragón. +++

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alcañiz. The tenth race weekend of the 2025 FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) at MotorLand Aragón (ESP) was all about thrilling battles between championship leader Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR) and runner-up Nicolò Bulega (ITA / Ducati). Starting from first and second on the grid, the two riders delivered breathtaking duels in all three races, keeping the nearly 30,000 spectators on the edge of their seats. In the first main race on Saturday afternoon, Razgatlioglu on the BMW M 1000 RR of the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team came out on top and celebrated his 13th consecutive victory. With this, he tied his own record set during the 2024 season. It was also Razgatlioglu’s first-ever win at MotorLand Aragón.

In the Superpole Race and in the second main race on Sunday, Bulega narrowly came out ahead each time, with Razgatlioglu finishing second on the podium in both races. In the championship standings, Razgatlioglu leads with 36 points over Bulega with two events remaining in the season. In the manufacturers’ standings, BMW is in second place, just six points behind Ducati.

Teammate Michael van der Mark (NED) continued his strong form from France at MotorLand Aragón. He finished tenth in the first race and secured the important ninth place in the Superpole Race, starting from the third row for the final second main race on Sunday. There, he was in eighth place on the last lap but unfortunately crashed and retired. The WorldSBK season will conclude with a double-header in October: first at Estoril, Portugal (10th to 12th October) and then the finale at Jerez de la Frontera, Spain (17th to 19th October).

Reactions after the MotorLand Aragón round.

Sven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “We are very positive about this weekend. We collected many important points here wt Aragón. Our goal was to win at this Ducati track, and we achieved that on Saturday with Toprak. On Sunday, we couldn’t beat a flawless Nicolò Bulega, but with two second-place finishes we achieved more excellent results. Mickey also had a generally good weekend. He is back and capable of fighting for the top ten or even the top five. The crash at the end was unfortunate, but overall we can build on this performance. Now we move on to Estoril in the title fight, where we also want to continue competing in the manufacturers’ championship. We had already had a taste of that title fight here when we led after Saturday’s win. We are confident that as a team we will perform well with both riders at Estoril.”

Christian Gonschor, Technical Director BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “It was a fantastic weekend. We knew that Ducati was the clear favourite here. The track suits their package particularly well but we put up an excellent fight. The races were thrilling, and it was clear: the decision comes down to the last corner. Here, Nicolò and his bike were in a class of their own. On Saturday, Toprak was able to make his way through with a strong manoeuvre and the victory was a wonderful gift for all of us. Sunday was incredibly close as well. Overall, however, we got the maximum out of this weekend. The entire team once again delivered outstanding work and set up the BMW M 1000 RR so that, on a track that doesn’t really favour us, we were absolutely on par. Now we move into the season finale full of motivation. We are more than ready!”

Toprak Razgatlioglu, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “Saturday’s victory was very important for me. I had never won here before and I am very happy that I now have my first victory at Aragón under my belt. The races here have been very hard, I was battling with Nicolò all the time but I also enjoyed that. In the second race, I then made a mistake in turn 7 and he could pull a bit of a gap. But even if I had continued to battle with him, my chance to take the win would have been very small because the Ducati had a big advantage in the last corner, it had better grip there, the bike was turning and accelerating well. They have a good package for Aragón. In the races, I tried everything, and I hope everyone enjoyed it! I did my best this weekend, I was very motivated, especially after I won the first race. That was very good for me. Overall, I am not so sad because I knew that Aragón is not a BMW but a Ducati track. We did a very good job, strong races, and it has been a very positive weekend for me. Not for 100 per cent, but I am happy. Now we are going to Estoril, we will see there. Nicolò is strong there, but I am, too.”

Michael van der Mark, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “Overall, the weekend was quite good. From the very first practice, I had a good feeling on the bike. In Superpole it wasn’t quite enough for the front rows, but in the first main race I made it into the top ten. The most important thing was that for Sunday I knew what I could still improve, and together with the team we had some ideas regarding the setup. Tyre wear is quite high here, but we managed that well. In the Superpole Race I really wanted to move up to the ninth position, and I succeeded. In race two I was also able to ride consistently and fight. My goal was to get back into the top five, but we were missing a bit of pace for that. At least I was back in the top eight, but then unfortunately I had a crash on the last lap. Sorry to the team for that. All in all though, I’m optimistic for Estoril and Jerez.”

# [ADDRESS] Hour: Kelvin van der Linde wins the IGTC Drivers’ Title – BMW M Motorsport secures Manufacturers’ Championship.
## Kelvin van der Linde crowned IGTC Drivers’ Champion +++ BMW M Motorsport wins the IGTC Manufacturers’ Championship for the first time +++ Team WRT celebrates third consecutive victory at the [ADDRESS] Hour +++
Date: 2025-10-19 | Author: Andrea Schwab BMW Group | ID: T0453409EN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Indianapolis. Kelvin van der Linde (RSA) was crowned Drivers’ Champion of the Intercontinental GT Challenge at the season finale. The South African took victory in a chaotic [ADDRESS] Hour (USA) alongside Charles Weerts (BEL) and Valentino Rossi (ITA) in the #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO fielded by Team WRT. Their teammates Raffaele Marciello (ITA), Augusto Farfus (BRA) and Al Faisal Al Zubair (OMA) completed the double podium by finishing third in the #777 BMW M4 GT3 EVO. With that, BMW clinched its first-ever Manufacturers’ Championship title in the IGTC. The “Battle on the Bricks” was initially halted for a long time due to a thunderstorm with heavy rain and eventually finished behind the safety car.

From the start of the weekend, the BMW M4 GT3 EVO showed strong pace on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. All five BMW cars made it into the Pole Shootout. Philipp Eng (AUT) set the fastest time there in the #51 Random Vandals Racing entry – but the team was stripped of pole position after the car was found to be slightly under the minimum weight. This promoted the #777 BMW M4 GT3 EVO of Team WRT to start from second place, directly ahead of its sister car, the #46.

In the race, the strong performance from qualifying continued as all BMW M4 GT3 EVOs impressed from the start. After three and a half hours, the four Pro entries occupied positions two through five when the title contenders took over driving duties for the first time: Marciello in the #777 BMW M4 GT3 EVO in second place, directly ahead of van der Linde in third. With two spectacular overtakes, the WRT duo soon took over the lead and established a 1–2 formation – before a thunderstorm moved over the circuit and brought out a red flag for more than two hours.

[ADDRESS] minutes before the end of the clock, the [ADDRESS] Hour resumed behind the safety car in heavy rain. Pit stops shuffled the order, putting van der Linde in the lead in the #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, while the #777 BMW M4 GT3 EVO with Marciello at the wheel lost two positions due to a later stop. The race was briefly restarted but soon ended again behind the safety car – with the #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO leading the field to the finish. Thus, Team WRT celebrated its third consecutive victory at the [ADDRESS] Hour, following wins in 2023 and 2024.

With its fourth win in five races this season, BMW also claimed the IGTC Manufacturers’ Championship for the first time, while van der Linde secured the Drivers’ Title. Earlier in the season, BMW M Motorsport and van der Linde had already triumphed at the [ADDRESS] Hour, the Nürburgring 24 Hours, and the Suzuka 1000KM. Just the previous Sunday, the South African and Weerts had also won the overall title in the GT World Challenge Europe.

Meanwhile, bad luck struck the #51 BMW M4 GT3 EVO of Eng, Bill Auberlen, and Varun Choksey (both USA). After a brilliant opening stint from tenth on the grid, the Random Vandals Racing car even led the race at one stage. However, a technical issue with the engine cost the team significant time in the pits, and they eventually retired after the red flag. Their teammates Connor De Phillippi, Conor Daly, and Kenton Koch (all USA) delivered a strong performance in the #99 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, finishing fourth overall. That result also secured De Phillippi and Koch the Drivers’ Title in the GT World Challenge America.

Turner Motorsport celebrated third place in the Pro-Am category with the #29 BMW M4 GT3 EVO driven by BMW M works driver Robby Foley alongside Patrick Gallagher and Justin Rothberg (USA). With that result, Foley and Rothberg also claimed the overall Pro-Am Championship title.

Quotes after the race:

Andreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “What an impressive season in the Intercontinental GT Challenge! Four wins out of five races underline the remarkable consistency of our teams and drivers. Congratulations to Team WRT for their third consecutive victory at the [ADDRESS] Hour. I am absolutely delighted that we were able to secure the Manufacturers’ title in the series for the first time. Congratulations also to Kelvin van der Linde on the Drivers’ Championship – even though Raffaele Marciello would have deserved it just as much. My compliments also go to Turner Motorsport and Robby Foley for their Pro-Am title, as well as to Random Vandals Racing, Connor De Phillippi, and Kenton Koch for their GTWC America crown. Many thanks to everyone at BMW M Motorsport and to all the teams who contributed to these outstanding achievements.”

Vincent Vosse (Team Principal, WRT): “It’s a great way to finish the Intercontinental GT Championship with a win in Indianapolis – our third in a row. Unfortunately, we made a mistake with the #777 by not calling them in at the right time. I feel very sorry for Lello, but that’s racing. Still, I’m very happy that we were able to bring this trophy home to BMW, and of course I’m very happy for Kelvin. The team did a fantastic job – having two BMW M4 GT3 EVOs on the podium is a great result. Thanks to the SRO for this championship; they did an excellent job this year.”

Kelvin van der Linde (#46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT, Drivers’ Champion): “The #777 deserved the win – they were stronger the whole weekend. But sometimes you just have bad luck in racing. Unfortunately, the weather decided the race today. Apart from that, four wins in five races make this an extraordinary year for BMW M Motorsport and Team WRT. We need to enjoy and celebrate that – it doesn’t happen every year. I’m very proud to have contributed a small piece of history in my first year with BMW M Motorsport.”

Charles Weerts (#46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT, Winner): “I’m obviously very happy for BMW M Motorsport to secure the championship in Indianapolis. It was a bizarre race with the thunderstorm and the rain, which unfortunately prevented us from really racing for most of the event. The #777 was very strong the whole weekend and was ahead of us at the time of the red flag – they definitely deserved the win today. But the most important thing is that BMW won.”

Valentino Rossi (#46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT, Winner): “I’m really happy – it was a great weekend. These kinds of races are the ones I really enjoy, and I also learn a lot from them. I think I did a good job in the first two hours. The #777 had great pace but was very unlucky. Overall, I’m very happy with the weekend and my performance because I really enjoyed it.”

Raffaele Marciello (#777 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT, 3rd place): “We had a lot of fun together as teammates. There’s just a great atmosphere within BMW. The race itself hurts a bit. The main goal was to secure the championship for BMW – and we did that, which makes me very happy. We won many races this season, and I’m very happy for Kelvin; he deserves it. But of course it hurts, and we’ll try again next year.”

Philipp Eng (#51 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Random Vandals Racing, DNF): “It was great to race with Random Vandals Racing. The team is fantastic, and the car was perfectly prepared. We were competitive from the very start of the weekend. The Superpole went perfectly – the car was great, and I managed a strong lap. The first stint was a lot of fun; fighting my way through the field from tenth after the penalty was great. Unfortunately, we had to retire because we lost too many laps due to a technical issue. But for me, it was a great experience racing with this team, and I’d love to come back.”

Robby Foley (#32 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Turner Motorsport, 3rd place Pro-Am): “It was a crazy race with the weather, but we had the clear goal of winning the title. Our competitors dropped out early, so we had to be smart, sensible, and mistake-free – and in the end, we came home third. It was a great season with Justin; he’s improved so much in just one year. To be back-to-back Pro-Am Champions is something very special. A huge thank you to Turner Motorsport and BMW M Motorsport for all the support.”

Connor De Phillippi (#99 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Random Vandals Racing, 4th place): “I’m very happy about the GT World Challenge America title. It’s my first championship since joining BMW M Motorsport. Kenton and the team did a fantastic job. It would have been nice to fight for the win here, but we had to secure our championship points. Still, it was a good day, a great year, and I’m already looking forward to 2026.”

# Endurance test for “Heart of Joy”: the BMW Vision Driving Experience.
## +++ Top-class dynamics, precision, efficiency and driving pleasure +++ New “Heart of Joy” central computer works ten times faster +++ Extending the recuperation range increases efficiency by 25% +++
Date: 2025-02-17 | Author: Dieter Falkensteiner BMW Group | ID: T0448122EN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Spartanburg / Munich. Showcasing driving pleasure up to the physical limits is the BMW Group’s mission with its new high-performance test vehicle – the BMW Vision Driving Experience. This Vision Vehicle is not destined for series production, but is instead serving as a rolling test rig for drivetrain and driving dynamics management technology developed specially for the Neue Klasse – the next generation of BMW vehicles – and referred to by BMW as the “Heart of Joy”. The prototype car put the capabilities of the Heart of Joy to the ultimate test of endurance at the BMW Performance Driving Center in Spartanburg, USA. And the company provided exclusive insights into its development programme for the electric driving experience on board the Neue Klasse as part of a preview presentation. Every fully electric Neue Klasse model will benefit from the Heart of Joy. The first taller Neue Klasse electric model will go into series production later this year at Plant Debrecen in Hungary. The new Heart of Joy adds a fourth dimension – BMW’s hallmark Sheer Driving Pleasure – to the existing trio of Neue Klasse characteristics (electrical, digital, circular). [EXECUTIVE_OFFICER], Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG, took to the stage at the IAA 2023 show holding the small black box. It is important to note that the control unit will go into series production, but the Vision Vehicle will not.

“The Heart of Joy enables us to take driving pleasure not just to the next level, but another one beyond that,” says Frank Weber, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, responsible for Development. “In addition, we are further increasing efficiency, and therefore boosting range, as in future the driver will brake almost exclusively using energy regeneration. This is Efficient Dynamics squared.”

Computer processing now ten times faster

The Heart of Joy control unit for the drivetrain, brakes, charging, recuperation and steering subfunctions processes information ten times faster than previous systems. Working in tandem with the BMW Dynamic Performance Control software, the Heart of Joy computes all the driving dynamics functions with a whole new level of speed and precision. The software has been developed entirely in-house on the back of experience in the field of driving dynamics amassed by BMW engineers over more than a century. The Vision Vehicle develops 18,000 Newton metres (13,269 lb-ft) of torque. The reasoning behind this is that if the control system can deal with an explosion of power of this magnitude, it will be able to handle the demands of everyday driving with ease.

Energy recovery under braking (also known as recuperation) sees the drivetrain and braking functions of electric vehicles forming a symbiosis. In the innovative electronics architecture of the Neue Klasse, the Heart of Joy is one of four central control units and combines drivetrain and driving dynamics functions for the first time. These innovative control functions are protected by several patent applications. The high-performance unit controls acceleration and braking, vehicle stabilisation, dynamic steering functions and charging management. The central processing unit and perfectly coordinated BMW Dynamic Performance Control software developed in-house enable all connected actuators to respond directly and with minimal delay: latencies are in the millisecond range. By contrast, conventional systems have separate control algorithms for the drive system and brakes. This means the full handling potential of vehicles with powerful electric drive systems cannot be fully exploited.

Precise cornering and the smoothest stopping process in the history of the car

The driver and passengers here experience a harmonious and noiseless driving feeling – regardless of the situation and speed they are travelling at. In dynamic driving scenarios, the new Heart of Joy / BMW Dynamic Performance Control combination serves up cornering poise and assurance beyond compare. The car generates impressive traction and can be threaded through corners with exceptional precision. Fewer control inputs are required and the car’s line can be maintained with greater precision and stability. This helps the car to develop consistent, reproducible cornering behaviour and allows it to be steered more intuitively and smoothly. At low speeds – such as in stop-start driving or when parking – direct signal transmissions and rapid information processing ensure an even more compelling driving experience. In driving modes D or B, or when using Active Cruise Control, the parking brake or parking lock, stopping and restarting merge seamlessly into one another.

Recuperation fuels a 25 per cent increase in efficiency

Furthermore, integrated drivetrain, braking and energy recuperation control allows energy to be used more sustainably. 98 per cent of drivers do not need to make any inputs using the conventional brakes. The braking power generated using energy recuperation is sufficient for normal, everyday driving. Only under heavy braking, e.g. in an emergency situation, is intervention required from the friction brakes. All in all, this system increases efficiency by up to 25 per cent.

The BMW Vision Driving Experience test vehicle demonstrates how the Heart of Joy works using illuminating colour codes on the wheel rims: acceleration is indicated in green, energy recuperation in blue and braking using the friction brakes in orange.

Four totally new super-brains will go to work in the BMW of the future. These high-performance computers cleverly combine various elements that previously ran separately. The Heart of Joy was developed 100 percent within the company. It allows four important control units to be brought together within a single high-performance computer.

Another three super-brains are responsible for features including automated and highly automated driving, infotainment and basic functions such as climate control and comfort-enhancing systems, vehicle access, interior and exterior lighting.

World Premiere at Shanghai Auto Show

The BMW Vision Driving Experience will celebrate its official world premiere at Auto Shanghai 2025.

Durante más de 50 años, la Colección BMW Art Car ha inspirado creatividad, innovación y diálogo entre un público global más amplio de entusiastas del arte y los automóviles”, dice Raymond Tan, Director General de BMW Hong Kong Services Limited.

La Gira Mundial de BMW Art Car. Art Basel Hong Kong marca una de las muchas paradas globales de la Gira Mundial de BMW Art Car, que abarca 2025 y 2026. La gira destaca el compromiso de la marca con la intersección del arte y la movilidad, con apariciones planificadas en eventos importantes como Taipei Dangdai, Market Art Fair, Concorso d’Eleganza y otros hitos culturales, incluidos museos de automóviles y festivales de coches clásicos.

Colectivo de Cine y Artes Mediáticas Africanas. En conjunto con la exhibición del Art Car, BMW y Julie Mehretu, junto con el productor Mehret Mandefro, están lanzando el Colectivo de Cine y Artes Mediáticas Africanas. Estos talleres, que se llevarán a cabo en 2025 en ciudades como Dakar, Lagos y Ciudad del Cabo, tienen como objetivo fomentar la creatividad y la colaboración entre jóvenes artistas y cineastas africanos. Los resultados de estos talleres se exhibirán junto al 20º BMW Art Car en el Museo Zeitz de Arte Contemporáneo de África (Zeitz MOCAA) en Ciudad del Cabo en 2026.

La Colección BMW Art Car. Artistas renombrados de todo el mundo han participado en el programa BMW Art Car desde 1975. La iniciativa surgió del piloto de carreras francés y amante del arte Hervé Poulain, quien, junto con el entonces jefe de Motorsport de BMW, Jochen Neerpasch, pidió a su amigo artista Alexander Calder que pintara un automóvil. El resultado fue un BMW 3.0 CSL, que compitió en las 24 Horas de Le Mans en 1975 y se convirtió en el favorito del público.

Este fue el nacimiento de la Colección BMW Art Car. En los años siguientes, artistas renombrados como Frank Stella, Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg, Esther Mahlangu, David Hockney, Jenny Holzer, Ólafur Elíasson y Jeff Koons enriquecieron la colección con más BMW Art Cars, cada uno en su propio estilo individual. Más recientemente, la artista multimedia china Cao Fei y el artista conceptual estadounidense John Baldessari presentaron cada uno un BMW Art Car basado en el BMW M6 GT3 y GTLM respectivamente en 2016 y 2017. Los BMW Art Cars no solo se exhiben en su hogar, el Museo BMW en Múnich, sino que también están de gira por todo el mundo como parte de exposiciones internacionales.

London/Munich. BMW Group and the London Symphony Orchestra present the 13th edition of BMW Classics in London’s renowned Trafalgar Square on [ADDRESS] June at 5pm. The concert highlights the continued partnership between the BMW Group and the London Symphony Orchestra, which since 2012 has brought superlative live orchestral music to audiences in one of the world’s most iconic public spaces and to tens of thousands more around the globe watching on YouTube. From this year, the concert and a selection of previous LSO concerts can also be streamed in selected BMW models.

The BMW Classics 2025 concert is conducted by new LSO Chief Conductor Sir Antonio Pappano for the first time, and the programme celebrates his Italian heritage with the prerequisite passion and soaring melodies from some of the great Italian composers for opera and orchestra. The concert will open with the spirited overture to Rossini ’s final Italian opera “Semiramide”, before Sir Antonio, renowned throughout the world as one of the great conductors of Puccini ’s operas will lead the orchestra with one of the composer’s early works for orchestra, “Capriccio sinfonico”.

For the central section of the concert, the LSO play the world premiere of Isabella Gellis ’ new work “Opera for Orchestra”, specially commissioned for this occasion and continuing the exploration of operatic repertoire. Her piece, written for a mixed-ability orchestra, brings together LSO and Guildhall School of Music & Drama musicians with 55 young musicians from east London as part of the LSO Discovery programmes.

For the final section of the concert, the Orchestra will perform the rousing Grand March from Verdi ’s opera “Aida”, and Victor de Sabata ’s exuberant symphonic poem “Juventus” (Youth).

In a new initiative starting this year, BMW drivers will also be able to stream the concert and a selection of previous LSO concerts from the comfort of their parked cars, via a dedicated app on the in-car entertainment systems of selected models. The content is made available via the Video App (DTS AutoStage Video Service Powered by TiVo™) in the latest infotainment systems of BMW and MINI*. The Video App brings together a wealth of video content from a wide range of providers, including news and live or on-demand shows. A number of streaming services are available internationally, including Joyn, Pluto TV, Bloomberg, TED, Yahoo! and Chili. These are accompanied by market-specific streaming services.

Commenting on this year’s concert, Dame Kathryn McDowell, Managing Director of the LSO said, “A big welcome to our new Chief Conductor Sir Antonio Pappano who conducts and presents his first BMW Classics concert this year, which is always a highlight of the Orchestra’s London Season and an important fixture in London’s summer calendar of music events. On behalf of the LSO and our audiences both in Trafalgar Square and online, a big thank you to our esteemed partner BMW, and the Mayor for London for making this possible.”

Ms [EXECUTIVE_OFFICER], Board Member for Human Resources and Real Estate at BMW Group : "We are very pleased to return to Trafalgar Square for BMW Classics, and to welcome Sir Antonio Pappano to conduct the concert for the first time this year. It is wonderful to celebrate the joy of classical music with so many people in the heart of London. BMW's global commitment to music and the arts has inspired people around the world for more than half a century. It is an honor for us to join the renowned London Symphony Orchestra on one of the most famous public stages in the world."

The Mayor of London, Mr Sadiq Khan : “The London Symphony Orchestra’s free performances in Trafalgar Square are a highlight of our cultural calendar. The BMW Classics are a unique chance for Londoners and visitors to enjoy world class classical music in the heart of our capital for free. It is also an incredible opportunity for young musicians to perform alongside this hugely talented orchestra, as we work to build a better London for everyone.”

Composer, Ms Isabella Gellis : “I am grateful to the London Symphony Orchestra for commissioning this piece, and I am doubly thrilled that for its premiere the LSO are forming a mega-orchestra with LSO Discovery young musicians. I cannot wait to hear them fill Trafalgar Square with sound at this year's BMW Classics.”

# The BMW M3 CS Touring is the fastest Touring on the Nürburgring-Nordschleife with a time of 7:29.5 minutes.
## +++ The fastest ever recorded time for a Touring in the "Green Hell" +++ Racing DNA meets maximised everyday usability +++
Date: 2025-07-31 | Author: Christian Pomp BMW Group | ID: T0451672EN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The success story at the Nürburgring continues. With a time of 7:29.490 minutes, the BMW M3 CS Touring (fuel consumption combined: 10.5 l/100 km; CO2 emissions combined: 238 g/km according to WLTP, CO2 class: G)* is the fastest Touring of all time on the Nürburgring-Nordschleife. Following the impressive record set by the BMW M2 CS (fuel consumption combined: 10.0 l/100 km; CO2 emissions combined: 226 g/km according to WLTP, CO2 class G)* which now holds the top spot in the compact category, the BMW M3 CS Touring is now another representative of the fastest production vehicles from BMW M GmbH in the mid-size category.

Note: BMW M3 CS Touring availability depends on each market.

Franciscus van Meel, CEO of BMW M GmbH, commented on this achievement: "From the very beginning, it was clear that the BMW M3 CS Touring would set new standards in dynamics. With a time under 7:30 minutes, this model impressively demonstrates that this vehicle concept perfectly combines racing DNA with everyday usability."

The ultimate "One Car Solution." The time of 7:29.490 minutes marks a new benchmark for the Touring in the mid-size category and is also the fastest ever recorded lap time for a Touring body style on the 20.823-kilometer-long track in the "Green Hell". In April of this year, Jörg Weidinger, BMW M development engineer and seasoned record driver, first broke the 7:30-minute barrier with a Touring Car. The previous fastest time for a Touring, set by the BMW M3 Touring in 2022, was 7:35.060 minutes.

The mid-size category is currently dominated by the latest models from the BMW M3 and M4 family. The BMW M4 CSL holds the fastest time at 7:18.137 minutes, followed by the BMW M4 CS at 7:21.989 minutes and the BMW M3 CS at 7:28.760 minutes. The new time of the BMW M3 CS Touring, just over a second behind, showcases the vehicle's extraordinary performance, reinforcing its reputation as the perfect "One Car Solution."

BMW M is at home on the Nürburgring. The origin and heart of BMW M's success story at the Nürburgring is the BMW M Test Centre. With its professional infrastructure and perfect location, it serves as the starting point for the successful development of new vehicle projects and testing under demanding conditions. The partnership between BMW M and the Nürburgring, which has thrived for over 25 years, is a great success and is visible from afar through landmarks such as the BMW M Power Grandstand and the BMW M Bridge. Through the offerings of the local BMW M Driving Experience, enthusiasts can drive BMW M vehicles themselves under professional guidance through the "Green Hell." The redesigned BMW M Power Showroom in 2021 emphasizes the significance of the Nürburgring as the home of BMW M. The Nürburgring Nordschleife, known worldwide as one of the most challenging racetracks, serves as a proving ground for drivers and vehicles. [ADDRESS].832 kilometres and featuring over 70 corners, it demands the highest performance and driving dynamics. Lap times are a benchmark for a vehicle's sporting capabilities, with record runs monitored by a neutral testing organization to ensure compliance with production standards. The Nürburgring plays a crucial role for BMW M not only in development and testing but also in motorsport. BMW M vehicles have achieved numerous successes, including 21 overall victories at the 24-hour race. This year, ROWE Racing secured the latest victory. After a challenging start to the weekend, the team raced from 17th position. Kelvin van der Linde (RSA), Augusto Farfus (BRA), Jesse Krohn (FIN), and Raffaele Marciello (SUI) delivered an outstanding comeback to clinch victory for BMW M Motorsport.

The first-ever BMW M3 CS Touring: Maximum performance, typical M feeling, and absolute everyday usability. The BMW M3 CS Touring combines unprecedented performance with maximum everyday usability, expanding the BMW M GmbH lineup with another special edition model in the high-performance sports car segment, now available for the first time as a Touring Car. [ADDRESS] kW/550 hp six-cylinder in-line engine propels the vehicle from 0 to 100 km/h in just 3.5 seconds, reaching a top speed of 300 km/h. The vehicle features specially designed engine mounting and an M-specific exhaust system that delivers an emotionally charged driving sound. Power is transmitted through an eight-speed M Steptronic transmission including Drivelogic and the M xDrive all-wheel-drive system, ensuring ultra-dynamic driving characteristics and supreme traction. The chassis technology is precisely tuned, with settings for the DSC stability control and M Dynamic Mode optimized for high-performance track use. The standard M Compound braking system guarantees powerful deceleration, while an optional M Carbon-ceramic brake system is available. The interior merges a performance-oriented sports car cockpit with digital technology, exclusive design features, and a versatile interior that expands storage capacity below the high-opening tailgate from 500 to 1,510 litres.

# BMW Group’s home plant gears up for NEUE KLASSE
## +++ Pre-series production to begin this summer +++ Lower manufacturing costs for NEUE KLASSE +++ Production Head Nedeljković: “Production network's strategic and flexible structure strengthens resilience and competitiveness” +++ Over one million cars built in Germany in 2024 +++
Date: 2025-02-27 | Author: Susanne Tsitsinias BMW Group | ID: T0448245EN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Munich. BMW Group Plant Munich is gearing up to launch the NEUE KLASSE in summer 2026. During ongoing series operation, three new production halls are currently being built for the body shop, assembly and associated production logistics. “For the production start of the NEUE KLASSE, we will have a state-of-the-art plant in Munich that is characterised by flexibility, innovation and, above all, efficiency,” says Plant Director Peter Weber.

Starting in 2027, the plant in Munich will exclusively produce fully-electric vehicles, further enhancing efficiency boost. Forward planning, close cooperation with development teams and suppliers, and the integration of modern production technology within new structures will all play a key role. “With the NEUE KLASSE, we will significantly reduce manufacturing costs at the Munich Plant,” says Weber. In addition to optimised production processes and targeted automation, the NEUE KLASSE’s new vehicle architecture will also leverage further efficiencies. Focusing on a single drive train variant reduces production steps and the number of parts – for example, for wiring harnesses, which previously varied according to engine type and can be complex to install.

Unusual process: Pre-series production at pilot plant The timeline for the ramp-up in Munich is carefully synchronised – in part due to the plant’s refurbishment. The first pre-series vehicles will be built at the pilot plant of the BMW Group Research and Innovation Centre (FIZ), with support from Plant Munich’s production team, before the end of the year. “Alongside the pilot plant at the FIZ, we are also using virtual simulations to ensure a smooth ramp-up,” says Weber, describing the unusual situation in the decisive year ahead of the launch. He adds that Plant Munich’s experienced launch team is also working closely with colleagues at the new plant in Debrecen, Hungary, where the first NEUE KLASSE model will enter production late this year.

International production network: Cooperation, flexibility and innovative processes BMW Group plants are capable of producing different model variants and drive train types on a single line. Since the ramp-up of electromobility is not linear and will progress at varying speeds, the company has relied on “flex-plants”, which can manufacture vehicles with both internal combustion engines and electric drive trains. “In this way, we can ensure our delivery capabilities in different market situations and maintain good capacity utilisation at our locations,” explains Milan Nedeljković, member of the Board of Management responsible for Production.

By the end of the decade, the BMW Group expects a significant increase in the market shares of fully-electric vehicles. For this reason, the plants in Debrecen and, later, Munich will be the first facilities dedicated exclusively to fully-electric vehicles, enhancing electrification capacities throughout the network.

The German plants lead the way on e-mobility in the BMW Group’s production network: Alongside traditional drive technologies, each of them builds at least one fully-electric model for the global market. Even in a volatile environment, the BMW Group continues to grow its domestic locations, manufacturing over a million vehicles there last year – accounting for a quarter of Germany's total automotive production.

At the same time, the company’s production also depends on a balanced global distribution of value creation. “The strategic and flexible structure of our production network strengthens our resilience and makes us more competitive,” adds Nedeljković.

Focus on employees: Developing skills for e-mobility The shift towards electrified vehicles also brings changes to employee roles and required skills. With the flexible ramp-up of e-mobility at BMW Group plants, employees can gradually be prepared for new job content.

“Despite technical and structural innovations, our focus is always on people. We take pride in our employees’ expertise and experience, and their dedication to continuous improvement. It is thanks to their commitment that we are able to consistently deliver premium-quality vehicles,” emphasises Weber. Additional expertise will be developed and retained at the company through extensive further training and workforce flexibility. Last year alone, nearly 25,000 employees completed e-mobility training. Plant Munich is currently holding its third industrial electrician qualification course, conducted in cooperation with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK).

In recent years, around 5,500 jobs have been created across the BMW Group production network for the current and upcoming generation of e-drives. More than three quarters of these positions were filled through internal reorganisation.

+++ Tournament setup for the ATP 500 debut unveiled in BMW Park +++ Zverev, Fritz, Struff, Shelton, Auger-Aliassime, Shapovalov, and Berrettini to play at BMW Open by Bitpanda +++ Rising star Engel receives first Wildcard +++

Munich. Just over three weeks before the first serve at the BMW Open by Bitpanda ([ADDRESS]-20, 2025, MTCC Iphitos), key details for its debut as an ATP-500 event were presented today at a press conference in BMW Park. BMW, the title partner for the 38th time, along with tournament partners, showcased a preview of the Munich tennis highlight on the spectacular video glass floor.

The presentation included a top-class player field, the new facility setup with a temporary centre court (capacity of 6,500 seats), new public catering, entertainment, and VIP areas, a new tournament logo, and a new presenting partner.

“We are very proud of the BMW Open, our longest-standing and most traditional sports engagement at BMW Group since 1987,” said Christian Ach, Head of BMW Germany, at the press conference. “This demonstrates BMW's commitment to continuously develop our sports engagements together with our partners. With the debut of the BMW Open by Bitpanda as an ATP-500 tournament, we have reached another important milestone. We look forward to offering the visitors a truly great tournament experience in every respect.”

This experience is greatly enhanced by the athletes themselves. After early confirmations from Alexander Zverev (GER), currently ranked second in the world, and Taylor Fritz (USA, ranked 4th), more top players have now been confirmed. Making his debut in Munich will be American rising star Ben Shelton . [ADDRESS]-year-old is currently ranked 12th in the ATP world rankings and recently made headlines as a semi-finalist at the Australian Open.

Returning to the BMW Open by Bitpanda is Canadian Felix Auger-Aliassime (ranked 18th). [ADDRESS]-year-old has already claimed two tournament victories this year and is currently ranked 4th in the Race to Turin. Another top 20 player on the list is Ugo Humbert (FRA, ranked 19th), who has won seven ATP titles in his career. Polish player Hubert Hurkacz (ranked 22the), who already has two Masters-1000 titles to his name, will also be making his BMW Open debut.

Munich can also look forward to another notable Canadian. Denis Shapovalov (ranked 28th) will play for the first time at Aumeister, bringing his powerful game to the forefront. He has already impressed this year with a tournament win at the ATP 500 in Dallas. Additionally, Francisco Cerundolo from Argentina (ranked 24th) and Jiri Lehecka from the Czech Republic (ranked27th), two more top 30 players have confirmed their participation.

Tennis fans will also reunite with Italian Matteo Berrettini (ranked 29th), who, after a long injury break last year, won three titles and is now back in the top 30, with an upward trend.

Defending champion Jan-Lennard Struff (GER, ranked 46th) returns to MTTC Iphitos, the site of his greatest success. Struff won his first ATP title in Munich in 2024 and will strive to leave the court in the BMW winner's car again in the 500-era.

The first wildcard of the BMW Open by Bitpanda goes to young talent Justin Engel from Nuremberg. [ADDRESS]-year-old made international headlines last year; he became the fourth youngest player in history to win an ATP match, after Michael Chang (USA), Rafael Nadal (ESP), and Carlos Alcaraz (ESP) – truly illustrious company. Another star of tomorrow is 19-year-old American Learner Tien , who sensationally fought his way from the qualifiers to the fourth round of the Australian Open and will also play at the BMW Open by Bitpanda, along with Gael Monfils (FRA), Daniel Altmaier (GER), Alexander Bublik (RUS), and two-time Munich finalist Botic van de Zandschulp (NED).

“We are particularly pleased that at the BMW Open by Bitpanda 2025, we will not only see world-class players with big names and exciting top talents but also a variety of athletes who are in outstanding form this season. Three from the top 6 in the 'Race to Turin' will be playing in Munich,” said tournament director Patrik Kühnen.

# BMW M4 CS Edition VR46: outstanding craftsmanship and passion combined with the aura and design ideas of the global star with the iconic #46
## +++ Exclusive edition model in collaboration with BMW M works driver Valentino Rossi is limited to two sets of 46 cars +++ BMW Group Plant Dingolfing produces BMW M4 CS Edition VR46, combining large-scale efficiency with manufacturing processes +++
Date: 2025-05-22 | Author: Christian Pomp BMW Group | ID: T0450346EN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To celebrate the 46th birthday of the nine-time motorcycle world champion Valentino Rossi, BMW M GmbH has showcased the BMW M4 CS Edition VR46 (combined fuel consumption: 10.2 l/100 km; combined CO 2 emissions: 232 g/km acc. WLTP, CO 2 class: G)*. Designers and product experts from BMW M worked closely with the current BMW M works driver to develop the exclusive edition model sporting Rossi’s world-famous number 46. “The Doctor”, or “Il Dottore”, was personally involved in the design process for the two distinctive Sport and Style design variants, each of which is limited to 46 cars. Having adopted “46” from his own father, the exceptional Italian racing driver retained the number throughout his career as it became his trademark and never even swapped it with the #1 of a reigning world champion. Every single BMW M4 CS Edition VR46 rolled off the production line at the BMW Group Plant Dingolfing between February and May – the result of a unique combination of large-scale processes and manual paintwork expertise.

The BMW M4 CS Edition VR46 "Style" and "Sport" variants will be on display at the Concorso d'Eleganza Villa d'Este 2025 from 23 to 25 May on the shores of Lake Como.

Tailor-made exclusivity and craftsmanship The BMW M4 CS Edition VR46 boasts special BMW Individual paint finishes that blend perfectly with the many exposed carbon surfaces. The Sport variant captivates thanks to a finish in Marina Bay Blue metallic with outsized “46” graphics in Tanzanite Blue metallic and bright yellow accents on the BMW M kidney grille, the brake calipers and the forged light-alloy wheels. In the “Style” design variant, the bodywork comes in matte Frozen Tanzanite Blue metallic, with the “46” in Frozen Marina Bay Blue metallic. The carbon-fibre roof of both variants is adorned with the VR46 logo and Rossi’s signature. Both the bonnet and the roof were manufactured and individually painted at BMW Group Plant Landshut. The component plant also provided the lightweight high-precision struts for the engine compartment and engine parts such as the crankcase and the cylinder head, which were installed in the high-performance drive system at BMW Group Plant Steyr.

Special production processes at BMW Group Werk Dingolfing The production of the BMW M4 CS Edition VR46 reveals the impressive levels of flexibility and skill applied to manufacturing exclusive small-batch series at BMW Group Plant Dingolfing. The Jeff Koons edition models for the BMW 8 Series and the 50 examples of the BMW 3.0 CSL first saw the light of day at the Bavarian plant, where high-tech manufacturing and craftsmanship go hand in hand, in the paint shop in particular.

For the BMW M4 CS Edition VR46, an underlying colour tone was applied as primer before the cars were removed from the series production process. The entire paintwork surface was then sanded down to improve the adhesion of the subsequent paint layers. The paintwork experts in Dingolfing then applied specially-made stencils to mask the “46” and other design elements, such as the bright yellow lines on the rear end and the A-column, before adding the contrast colour to the masking film. Once all the layers of paint had dried and the masking film had been removed, a clear varnish coating was added to the design area by hand and then sanded down – after drying again – to guarantee seamless transitions and a flawless surface. The cars then returned to the regular series production process to receive another layer of clear varnish and for the installation of the carbon-fibre roof that was manufactured in Landshut. Overall, each car required 20 hours’ work from a small team of four hand-picked paint experts to complete the exclusive BMW Individual paint finish on the BMW M4 CS Edition VR46.

Vehicle assembly: components and interior characterised by VR46 The next step in the production process took the edition cars to Dingolfing for assembly. The exclusive design is also reflected in the installed components, such as the bumpers specially painted in Landshut, and on the inside of the car. Night Blue dominates in the interior, with yellow accents. The M Carbon bucket seats have a shoulder area in Sao Paulo Yellow, with yellow contrast stitching and a yellow centre marker on the steering wheel. The headrests and door sill trims feature a prominent yellow VR46 logo, while the carbon-fibre centre console of all examples features a “1/46” badge. Having passed extensive quality controls, the cars of this exclusive edition are now ready for delivery to the two sets of 46 customers around the world.

Includes a “once in a lifetime” experience for customers Customers who purchase one of the 405 kW/550 HP BMW M4 CS Edition VR46s also enjoy the added value of a “once in a lifetime” experience: an exclusive personal meeting with Valentino Rossi at his home, the VR46 Motor Ranch in Tavullia (ITA), and a BMW M Driving Experience with current BMW M models at the Misano World Circuit Marco Simoncelli. Rossi, at the wheel of a BMW M4 GT3, won GT World Challenge Europe Sprint Cup races at his home circuit in both 2023 and 2024 and is aiming to complete a hat-trick this year. “The Doctor” has been a BMW M works driver since the start of the 2023 season, plying his trade at the wheel of a BMW M4 GT3 for BMW M Team WRT, having called time on his motorcycle career at the 2021 season finale and turned his attention solely to car racing. He had already attended multiple tests in [ADDRESS] race cars and made guest appearances in rallies and endurance races. The Italian has been competing as a BMW M works driver in the GT World Challenge Europe, with the 24 Hours of Spa (BEL) as a highlight, as well as racing in the legendary 24 Hours of Le Mans (FRA) or at the [ADDRESS] Hour (AUS), where he celebrated second place in the BMW M4 GT3 at the opening round of this season’s Intercontinental GT Challenge (IGTC).

Creating a legend on two wheels “Il Dottore” had already become a living legend and global motorsport and style icon on two wheels. With nine world championships and no fewer than 115 Grand Prix victories to his name, he is one of the three most successful motorcycle racers in history. Rossi claimed his first world title in the 125cc class in 1997. Two years later, he added the title in the 250cc class. In 2000, he took the step up to what was the top Grand Prix category, the 500cc class, in which he was crowned world champion in 2001. Rossi remained the dominant force when this category was replaced by the MotoGP class the following year. By 2005 he had added a further four world titles, and numbers eight and nine were to follow in 2008 and 2009. VR46 became a world-famous trademark – and Rossi’s home town of Tavullia even reduced its speed limit from the usual 50 km/h to 46 km/h in his honour.

BMW Motorrad's leading position in the sports bike segment is also underpinned by the third place of the S 1000 RR.

With the uncompromisingly dynamic BMW M 1000 R powerhouse, a second M model from BMW Motorrad has once again taken the top spot. With its unrivalled chassis technology and aerodynamics, the BMW M 1000 R opens up dimensions of riding dynamics previously reserved for purebred super bikes in its segment, taking the top step of the podium in the Power Naked category. The BMW R 1250 R - with its strong character - also took third place in this category.

For the second year in a row, the powerful long-distance sports bike BMW M 1000 XR is the top M model from BMW Motorrad. With an engine output of 148 kW (201 hp), an empty weight of just 223 kg and chassis technology and aerodynamics designed for high performance on the open road, long distance touring and fast laps on the race track, the BMW M 1000 XR is the benchmark in its segment and immediately secured first place in the "Crossover" category as it did last year.

Together with its sister model, the R 1300 GS Adventure, the BMW R 1300 GS further cemented the cult status of the BMW boxer GS models by taking first place in the Adventure Touring category. With their new design, powerful engine, outstanding handling and convincing on-road and off-road riding characteristics, both models once again confirm the Bavarian dominance in this hotly contested segment.

With the new F 900 GS, BMW Motorrad takes the top spot in the Enduro/Supermoto category for the first time. With its greatly enhanced off-road capabilities and significant weight reduction compared to its predecessor, the F 900 GS wins this category for the first time in its debut year.

The BMW R 1250 RS is another repeat winner. Following the clear victories of the past years, the BMW R 1250 RS is the winner in the "Tourer/Sport Tourer" segment once again. Thanks to its excellent all-round qualities in the areas of riding dynamics, sportiness and touring suitability, it was able to keep the strong competition at bay once again.

In the Modern Classics category, the new BMW R 12 and R 12 nineT models took second place with their combination of classic and purist design, modern technology and legendary air/oil-cooled boxer engine.

The 27th edition of MOTORRAD magazine's Motorcycle of the Year 2025 Readers' Choice Awards, which are considered to be the most important motorcycle and scooter readers' choice awards in Europe, took place in Stuttgart on 1 April 2025.

Woodcliff Lake, NJ – [ADDRESS], 2025… BMW is presenting its next leap forward in the field of electric drive technology – and in the process ushering in a new era of all-electric driving. At the Tech Days event in Landshut, the company has provided some initial insights into the development and production of high-voltage batteries and electric drive systems using the sixth generation of BMW eDrive technology. Every fully electric Neue Klasse vehicle will enjoy the benefits. The first Neue Klasse model will go into series production later this year at Plant Debrecen in Hungary. Below is an overview of the technology highlights:

Adopting a technology-open approach while setting the pace in electric mobility

“For BMW, electric mobility is the future and a key area of growth. We are leading the way with this drivetrain technology. At the same time, we are deliberately taking a technology-open approach, recognizing that mobility needs vary between different regions of the world,” explains Dr Joachim Post, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Purchasing and Supplier Network. “We want to offer our customers the best drive concept for every need. It is possible to do both: offer the best drive technology for every need and be at the forefront of electric mobility.”

Slimmer, faster, further: the high-voltage batteries for Gen6

With the new sixth-generation BMW eDrive technology (Gen6 for short), BMW is making a technological quantum leap. Improvements on the product side include a 30% faster charging speed and 30% increase in range, with certain models achieving even higher figures. Added to which, the Gen6 high-voltage battery concept benefits from the new 800V technology. Gen6 will make its debut this year in the Neue Klasse and subsequently be used to drive models across BMW’s fully electric product range. The concept for the Gen6 high-voltage batteries is fundamentally new and will find applications in all vehicle segments – right up to the high-performance models from BMW M GmbH. Its new, slimmer design allows the high-voltage battery to be integrated into a spread of different models, regardless of vehicle height. The high-voltage battery takes on the role of a structural component in the bodies of the Neue Klasse models (“pack-to-open-body”), and the new cylindrical cells will be integrated directly into the high-voltage battery (“cell-to-pack”). The new BMW cylindrical cell has a 20% greater energy density than its predecessor, the Gen5 prismatic battery cell. And charging in both directions will be possible: BMW has confirmed bidirectional charging as standard for Gen6.

Highly intelligent central control unit: the BMW Energy Master

All of the elements that enable this technological leap forward come together in the BMW Energy Master. This central control unit is positioned on the high-voltage battery and provides the interface for high- and low-voltage power supply and for data from the high-voltage battery. It also controls the power supply for the electric motor and vehicle electrical system and ensures the safe and intelligent operation of the high-voltage battery. BMW has filed a whole series of new patent applications for the vehicle electrical system, including its electronic fuses. Both the hardware and software of the Energy Master were developed fully in-house at BMW. This ensures technological developments and updates for vehicles can be implemented independently and in real time via Remote Software Upgrades, providing a particular benefit for customers.

“Local for local” approach for high-voltage battery assembly and supplier network

The high-voltage batteries for the Neue Klasse are assembled in five new production facilities that BMW has located close to its vehicle plants as part of a “local for local” approach. For example, cutting-edge assembly locations for Gen6 high-voltage batteries are taking shape in Irlbach-Straßkirchen (Lower Bavaria), Debrecen (Hungary), Shenyang (China), San Luis Potosí (Mexico), and Woodruff, near Spartanburg (USA). This approach safeguards production even in the event of unforeseen political and economic events. In addition, the existing locations are being strengthened, with jobs both secured and created. The “local for local” principle continues in the supplier network for battery cells: in order to cover the demand for Gen6, BMW has reached contractual agreements for five battery cell factories – spread across Europe, China and the USA – with various partners.

“Cell-to-pack” and “pack-to-open-body”

Production of the Gen6 high-voltage batteries follows the “cell-to-pack” and “pack-to-open-body” principles. “Cell-to-pack” involves positioning the cylindrical cells – manufactured by the suppliers according to BMW specifications – directly in the housing of the high-voltage battery, without the intermediate step of a module being produced. “Pack-to-open-body” refers to the high-voltage battery’s new role as a structural component in the vehicle architecture. Numerous innovations patented by BMW can be found here.

Know-how from Bavaria and Austria – in demand around the world

Before series production of the high-voltage batteries gets underway worldwide, the production processes will be developed and pre-series batteries subjected to thorough testing. This will happen at BMW pilot plants for high-voltage batteries in Parsdorf, Hallbergmoos, and Munich. The new series production plants around the world will then be ready. The product and process expertise is centerd in Bavaria. Production of the Energy Master will take place at Plant Landshut, which will then supply all the high-voltage battery assembly plants around the world. There, the highly intelligent control unit will be installed on the high-voltage battery. The electric motor with sixth-generation BMW eDrive technology is produced at Plant Steyr in Austria, which is also home to a development center for electric drive systems and thermal management.

Production of the Energy Master at BMW Plant Landshut

A state-of-the-art production system for the BMW Energy Master is taking shape at Plant Landshut. The plant is currently producing the highly complex control unit in pre-series. Series production on the first production line will begin in August 2025, with a further expansion stage to follow in mid-2026. This is the first time the development and production of this central control unit has taken place in-house at BMW. “As the company’s largest in-house component manufacturer, Landshut plays an important role for the Neue Klasse,” says Dr Joachim Post. “The plant is an innovation hub and a driver of transformation.” [ADDRESS] people will be employed in the Energy Master production area at Landshut when production begins, rising to as many as 700 people as it ramps up further. BMW has channelled investment in the high hundreds of millions of euros into the expansion of electric mobility at Plant Landshut since 2020, strengthening both the production facility itself and Germany’s status as an industrial powerhouse for the long term. The modular manufacturing system used to produce the Energy Master was also designed fully in-house by BMW. It is supplied with subcomponents by a supply chain set up by BMW. This extends to the n-tier supply chain for supply-critical components such as semiconductors. The benefits of this set-up can be seen in terms of both costs and supply security. The scalable production system enables the company to respond quickly and flexibly to market requirements. The high degree of automation, involving up to 400 robots in the final expansion stage, maximises efficiency. Comprehensive in-process monitoring, which includes the use of AI-based camera systems, and 100-per-cent end-of-line system checks in a clean-room environment ensure optimum quality.

Different recycling processes within the value chain

As electric mobility ramps up, there is an increasing focus on recycling of high-voltage batteries at the end of their lifecycle. Under a long-term partnership with SK tes – a leading provider of innovative technology lifecycle solutions – cobalt, nickel and lithium from end-of-life batteries are recovered from BMW and integrated into the supply chain for the manufacture of new batteries. This closed-loop approach increases the efficiency and resilience of BMW as part of a circular economy. BMW will follow a similar path in the USA, Mexico, and Canada up to 2026 with a separate partnership.

Innovative direct recycling at BMW

BMW is also exploring other recycling options in the value creation process. One example of this is the direct recycling method developed in-house. BMW is working with its joint venture Encory to set up a competence center for battery cell recycling in Lower Bavaria, where the company will put its direct recycling ideas into practice. This innovative process will enable residual materials from battery cell production and whole battery cells to be mechanically broken down into their valuable constituent components. The raw materials obtained in this way will be re-used directly in the pilot production process for battery cells at the company’s competence centers.

Technology-open approach for electric mobility: the new e-drive system of Gen6

BMW has retained the principle of an electrically excited synchronous motor (EESM) for its Gen6 power unit. On this type of synchronous motor, the magnetic field in the rotor is generated by windings fed with direct current rather than permanent magnets. In this way, the strength of the rotor’s magnetic field can be optimally adjusted to the prevailing load conditions. This results in both excellent levels of efficiency at customer-relevant operating points and constant power output at high rotational speeds. As with the Gen5 version, the synchronous motor will be positioned above the rear axle and feature a compact housing incorporating the electric drive unit, power electronics and transmission. Many of the motor’s technical details were created with the help of patented expertise, with the non-potted rotor alone accounting for more than ten patent applications.

Neue Klasse additionally incorporates ASM technology

The Gen6 powertrain employs a second, additional electric motor technology in the form of the asynchronous motor (ASM). Here, instead of being generated by permanent magnets (PSM) or electrical excitation (EESM), the rotor’s magnetic field is induced by the stator. On this type of motor, the rotor takes the form of a metal cage. The asynchronous motor offers the advantage of a more compact design and superior cost efficiency. The ASM motor variants will be fitted at the front axle of Neue Klasse cars with BMW xDrive.

Extensive improvements to EESM technology

Besides the addition of ASM technology, the EESM technology has also undergone a major upgrade for Gen6: rotor, stator and inverter have all been fully designed for the new 800V architecture of the Gen6 tech in order to maximise drive system performance and efficiency. This has been further helped by a complete redesign of the oil and water cooling systems. In addition to this, the experts from BMW have also succeeded in improving the electric motor and central housing in terms of their weight and rigidity. The transmission still uses a two-stage helical design, but has been further optimized by enhancements to its geometry and cooling, lower friction levels and more pleasant acoustics. The electrically excited synchronous motor’s “brain”, the inverter, now features 800V technology along with silicon carbide (SiC) semiconductors to boost efficiency. The inverter is completely integrated into the electric motor’s housing. Its task is to convert the DC power supply from the high-voltage battery to AC for use in the electric motor. The inverter was developed in-house by BMW and is produced at Plant Steyr in Austria.

Lower weight, costs and energy losses – greater efficiency in the vehicle

The results obtained from intelligently incorporating new technologies into the electric powertrain while consistently enhancing existing systems make impressive reading. When compared to a Gen5 xDrive model, a future Neue Klasse model complete with EESM and ASM technology boasts the following improvements: energy losses have been reduced by 40%, costs by 20% and weight by 10%. By combining different types of electric motor, BMW’s technology-open approach is therefore clearly in evidence within the field of electric mobility. In future, customers will be able to choose from models equipped with one, two, three or four electric motors to suit their individual preferences and requirements. The sixth generation BMW eDrive technology is a significant factor in the gain in overall vehicle efficiency of around 20% for the Neue Klasse. This figure is based on a comparison with the current generation of all-electric vehicles from BMW.

Modular concept provides crucial advantage for manufacturing electric motors

The manufacturing concept for the Gen6 electric drive system uses the principle of modular building blocks. This forms the basis for highly flexible manufacturing of various electric drive variants across the entire Neue Klasse model range. The modular "building block” concept leads to positive economies of scale and cost savings in development and production. It also has the effect of improving the scalability of production volumes. The modular approach ensures a high degree of flexibility in production, the supply networks and procurement.

The Gen6 electric drive systems: made in Steyr

Series production of the Gen6 electric drive systems will commence at BMW Plant Steyr in summer 2025. Pre-production already got underway at the Austrian facility in September 2024. The pre-production motors are undergoing rigorous testing and some are already being fitted in Neue Klasse test vehicles from Plant Debrecen. By 2030, BMW will have invested over one billion euros at the site since the project’s launch in 2022 to expand its development and production expertise for electric drive systems. Thanks to the increase in capacity, the plant will retain its status as BMW’s leading facility for drive systems. The plant has been developing and building combustion engines for the BMW and MINI brands for over 40 years. Plant Steyr’s many years of experience and high level of expertise in the field of drive systems make it the ideal site for manufacturing the Gen6 electric motors. It has an annual production capacity of 600,000 electric drive units. Diesel and petrol engines continue to be manufactured there alongside the electric motors. By 2030, around half of the on-site employees should be working in electric mobility – a vital step for safeguarding the more than 4,700 jobs at the plant in the long term. In future, all key components of the innovative, highly integrated electric drive unit – i.e. the rotor, stator, transmission, inverter and housing – will be produced at Steyr. This will include manufacturing the inverters in an in-house clean room environment for the first time, thereby taking the engine plant into the realm of electrical engineering. The electric drive components will be built on two new assembly lines at Steyr.

Thermal management: complex interaction, crucial for performance

Thermal management involves highly complex interaction between various systems in an electric vehicle and is of critical importance for a host of performance parameters, including range, real-world consumption, acceleration and charging time. Thermal management is a question of constantly keeping the temperature of the electric motor, power electronics and high-voltage battery in the optimum range, while maintaining standards of passenger comfort at the same time. Efficient thermal management is important for fast charging too. Here, the battery temperature must be kept within a defined window in order to make optimum use of the available charging capacity. Unlike combustion engines, electric motors give off little heat. This means that, depending on the operating state, the battery and the passenger cell have to be not only cooled, but heated too. The Steyr site develops the thermal management systems for all electric vehicles from BMW. The plant’s development center is also responsible for the brain at the heart of the electric motor – the inverter.

BMW Plant Landshut – a multi-talented component manufacturer

BMW Plant Landshut is BMW’s largest component plant anywhere in the world, supplying components to all the company’s vehicle and drive system plants. Its workforce of around 3,700 employees produces a broad spectrum of cutting-edge components for vehicles from BMW. Working closely with BMW’s Research and Innovation Center (FIZ) in Munich, Plant Landshut plays a pivotal role as a hub of innovation for the automotive industry. It develops pioneering technologies and manufacturing processes that serve to maintain the company’s competitive edge. Over the course of the Neue Klasse project, the site is investing some €200 million in its light metal foundry to increase annual production capacity for the electric motor housings. The Injector Casting (ICA) process developed and patented in Landshut is a prime example of the plant’s innovative strength. This globally unique process is used to manufacture the electric motors’ highly complex aluminium housings that set new standards for lightweight design and functional integration.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Indianapolis. BMW M Team RLL narrowly missed out on another podium in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship despite a strong performance. In the six-hour race at Indianapolis Motor Speedway (USA), Marco Wittmann (GER) and Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) staged an impressive comeback in the #25 BMW M Hybrid V8, climbing from seventh on the grid up to second place. Shortly before the end of the race, however, van der Linde was forced to save fuel, dropping the duo back to sixth.

Their teammates Philipp Eng (AUT) and Dries Vanthoor (BEL) in the #24 BMW M Hybrid V8 were set back early on by a drive-through penalty. In a turbulent race with numerous full course yellow periods, they still managed to collect important championship points by finishing fourth.

There was plenty to celebrate at Paul Miller Racing. Max Hesse (GER) and Dan Harper (GBR) took the #48 BMW M4 GT3 EVO from pole position to the podium in the GTD-PRO class. Harper had been unbeatable in qualifying, securing his first-ever pole award in the GTD-PRO category. On Sunday, Harper and Hesse fought for victory for a long time before eventually celebrating their third podium of the season with a strong third place finish.

Their teammates Neil Verhagen, Madison Snow and Connor De Phillippi (all USA) also showed strong pace in the #1 BMW M4 GT3 EVO after starting from ninth. At the three-hour mark, they were even leading the GTD-PRO class ahead of the sister car, collecting important Endurance Cup points. After six hours, the local favourites crossed the line in eighth place in class.

Turner Motorsport also delivered a strong performance in the GTD category, moving up from 14th on the grid. Robby Foley, Patrick Gallagher and Jake Walker (all USA) narrowly missed the podium, finishing fourth in the #96 BMW M4 GT3 EVO.

Quotes after the race:

Andreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “After the 1-2 finish at Road America, we once again showed strong performance here in Indianapolis with the BMW M Hybrid V8. Unfortunately, the impressive comeback by Marco and Sheldon was not rewarded with the podium they deserved. The fourth place for Dries and Philipp is a good result, especially considering the penalty, and brings important championship points. Congratulations to Paul Miller Racing on a strong weekend, highlighted by the pole position and the podium finish for the #48. Now we are looking forward to the season finale at Road Atlanta.”

Philipp Eng (#24 BMW M Hybrid V8, BMW M Team RLL, 4 th place): “It was not an easy weekend. Our competition, especially Acura and Cadillac, simply had more pace than we did. Still, we had a solid race. The penalty was unfortunate, but race control had announced they would be very strict – and they were for the whole field. Dries did a great job in qualifying and especially at the end. With fourth place we scored important championship points.”

Sheldon van der Linde (#25 BMW M Hybrid V8, BMW M Team RLL, 6 th place): “Obviously not the result we hoped for in the end. We had the potential to achieve more. The car was stronger than we expected at the beginning of the weekend, which is very positive. We did many things very well this weekend. It’s encouraging to see that we are improving and moving in the right direction but there are also things we need to review. We will do that as a team to come back stronger for Petit Le Mans which is one of the biggest races of the year and one we would all love to win. Hopefully we can finish the year on a high.”

Dan Harper (#48 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paul Miller Racing, 3 rd place GTD-PRO):

“It was a fantastic weekend. I’m really happy to be back on the podium after a few tough races. In the Endurance Cup we are right back in the title fight. At the three-hour mark we scored maximum points with both cars – and then added more with third place at the end. That puts us in a strong position for the finale at Petit Le Mans. My personal highlight was my first pole position yesterday. It was an amazing feeling, and I think we really deserved it this season. A few times I came very close, and the team always gave me a car capable of it so it was nice to get that one and now let’s move on to the last round.”

# BMW is once again bringing an exclusive study for a small series to Lake Como this year: The BMW Concept Speedtop
## +++ Exclusive three-door interpretation of a BMW Touring +++ Unique colour and material concept +++ Limited-run small series for collectors and enthusiasts +++
Date: 2025-05-26 | Author: Laura Kanamueller BMW Group | ID: T0450391EN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Munich/Cernobbio. At the Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este 2025, the renowned celebration of historic vehicles on the shores of Lake Como in Italy, the BMW Group is presenting an exclusive new concept car that will subsequently be made available for purchase in a small series.

The BMW Concept Speedtop reimagines the sporty Touring, blending the elegance of a shooting brake with unique proportions. "A true BMW exudes dynamism and elegance even when it’s standing still," says Adrian van Hooydonk, Head of BMW Group Design. "And that’s also the case with our new concept car. The BMW Concept Speedtop is characterised first of all by its profile. It is very unique in the automotive industry. In this way, we have created an exclamation mark for our entire lineup of vehicles, especially for the Touring models."

The generous interior invites for weekend getaways for two. High-quality materials, the focus on every detail, and the stylistic connection between exterior and interior are a testament for its true craftsmanship.

The BMW Concept Speedtop shares its eye-catching form language with the BMW Skytop and will be offered to collectors and connoisseurs in a strictly limited small series.

Unique profile, dynamic proportions

The pronounced V-shape of the front end, with its shark-nose design, the slim front lights and the illuminated kidney grille give the BMW Concept Speedtop an unmistakable presence. The continuation of the central spline from the bonnet over the roof to the rear spoiler gives the car a dynamic Touring profile. The colour gradient on the roof, moving from “Floating Sunstone Maroon” to “Floating Sundown Silver”, accentuates this shape. The athletic design is enhanced by the car’s broad shoulders. Its elegance is underscored by two-tone, 14-spoke wheels, which have been designed specifically for the BMW Concept Speedtop.

Luxurious craftsmanship

The interior of the BMW Concept Speedtop was designed with a strong focus to even the smallest detail. Skillfully crafted, traditional brogue-style details accentuate the leather-trimmed surfaces and emphasise the manufactory-level craftmanship on display. The two-tone colour and material concept creates a connection between the exterior and interior. The sparkling brown tone of the “Floating Sunstone Maroon” exterior paint is carried over into the interior. Here, the brown "Sundown Maroon" world harmonises with the light "Moonstone White" of the seats. The two-tone leather upholstery divides the dynamic and functional areas of the interior. The visually striking roof spline in the exterior is mirrored as a light beam in the two-tone leather headliner, providing an atmospheric, indirect illumination.

The virtuosity in the design of the BMW Concept Speedtop is further enhanced through the collaboration with the traditional Italian manufacturer Schedoni. Known for the production of exclusive and high-quality leather goods by hand, especially in the automotive sector, Schedoni has always stood for highest quality and customisation. Two storage areas with leather straps behind the seats provide space for two of Schedoni’s made-to-measure bags. The bags were designed exclusively for the Concept to fit in with its colour and material concept. A matching weekend bag can also be accommodated in the trunk.

Most powerful V8 in the portfolio and limited-run small series

The concept car’s engine ensures it scales the heights not only in terms of design, but also performance. It is fitted with the most powerful V8 engine currently offered by BMW.

"Last year, the presentation of the BMW Concept Skytop at the Concorso d'Eleganza Villa d'Este on Lake Como generated great enthusiasm among connoisseurs and automotive enthusiasts," says Bernd Körber, Senior Vice President BMW Brand and Product Management. "This led to a strictly limited production run of 50 units. Thanks to this positive response, this year we have decided to also offer the BMW Concept Speedtop in a limited production series of 70 units. This extraordinary vehicle is now available for order. We are pleased to be able to offer collectors and enthusiasts another exclusive model."

The BMW M2 Racing performed excellently under typically chaotic Eifel conditions and proved that it delivers everything we expect from our new entry-level race car. Many thanks to the team at FK Performance Motorsport, the drivers, and the BMW M Motorsport engineers for this strong and professional performance. With a total of 13 class victories, our teams have demonstrated that they are capable of winning with various BMW M Motorsport race cars – and will certainly play a leading role in the 24-hour race. That only increases my anticipation for the season highlight. Congratulations also to BMW Italia Ceccato Racing and Century Motorsport on their successes in the Italian GT and British GT. The ‘Crazy Month of June’ with three major 24-hour races in a row – along with many other customer racing highlights – can come!”

24h Nürburgring Qualifiers: Baptism by rain for the BMW M2 Racing.

The BMW M2 Racing experienced the full toughness of the “Green Hell” last weekend at the 24h Nürburgring Qualifiers, passing its ultimate test ahead of the endurance classic in June with flying colors. The first of two four-hour races on Saturday evening in particular, held in pouring rain, put the new BMW M Motorsport entry-level race car, the FK Performance Motorsport team, and the three drivers – BMW M works drivers Ugo de Wilde and Charles Weerts (both BEL), along with motorsport journalist Michael Bräutigam (GER) – to the test. The BMW M2 Racing ran flawlessly however, and crossed the finish line second in its SP3T class. In Sunday’s race, the car emerged largely unscathed from an unavoidable collision and secured third place in class.

“The BMW M2 Racing completed both races without any technical problems,” said Weerts. “It’s a lot of fun to drive. It has a lot of mechanical grip, which allows for quite high cornering speeds. Even under Saturday’s extreme conditions with heavy rain, the car gave us a good feeling and performed strongly. On Sunday I was hit pretty hard by another competitor, but there was hardly any damage to the car, and we were able to finish the weekend successfully and gain a lot of insights.” De Wilde added: “It was my first time with the BMW M2 Racing on the Nordschleife – and it was a fantastic experience. I earned my permit with the BMW M240i Racing, and the differences to the new car are enormous. The BMW M2 Racing is easier to drive, the suspension and brakes are significantly improved. I felt very comfortable. For me personally, it was important to get to know the Nordschleife better – especially under crazy conditions. After this weekend, I understand why it’s called the ‘Green Hell’. Still, I’m really looking forward to the 24-hour race.”

[ADDRESS] Nürburgring Qualifiers were generally a great success for the BMW M Motorsport teams. With six class wins on Saturday and seven on Sunday, the teams had an impressive dress rehearsal for June’s season highlight. The new BMW M4 GT4 EVO dominated the SP8T class with quadruple victories on both days. First place on each occasion went to FK Performance Motorsport. A BMW M4 GT4 EVO also competed in the AT3 class, where the Giti Tire Motorsport by WS Racing team won both races. No BMW M4 GT3 EVO participated in the top SP9 class. ROWE Racing will return to action at the 24-hour race.

Italian GT Championship: BMW Italia Ceccato Racing starts the Sprint season with a victory.

BMW M works drivers Jens Klingmann (GER) and Jesse Krohn (FIN), along with BMW Italia Ceccato Racing, made a strong start to the Sprint season of the Italian GT Championship at Vallelunga (ITA). Klingmann and the team led by Roberto Ravaglia (ITA) are defending champions, and Krohn has now rejoined as a full-time driver for the sprint races. In the first race on Saturday, the duo took victory in the #1 BMW M4 GT3 EVO. Due to regulations, they had to serve pit stop penalties in Sunday’s race but still managed seventh overall and fifth in the GT3 Pro class.

“Vallelunga was a very strong weekend for us,” said Klingmann. “With Saturday’s win, we’ve started our title defense mission for the third year in a row. That gave us and the team a lot of confidence that we’re competitive and can fight for the title again. On Sunday, we tried to make the most of the pit stop penalties, which are based on Saturday’s results, and to limit the damage. At the next sprint race at Mugello, we’ll be penalty-free again and ready to go all out. Our mission this year is clear: we want to defend the title. I’m very happy to have made a strong statement with Roberto Ravaglia’s team and my teammate Jesse.”

“I’m very happy to be back with BMW Italia Ceccato Racing in the Italian GT Championship, and it was great to start the season with a win,” said Krohn. “I’m here to help the team win a third title, and I’ll do everything I can to make that happen. I’m also thrilled to be racing with Jens again. He was one of my first teammates when I joined BMW M Motorsport eleven years ago.”

Their teammates William Alatalo (FIN) and Leonardo Caglioni (ITA) also started the Sprint season successfully in the #2 BMW M4 GT3 EVO. On Saturday, they finished third overall and took victory in the GT3 Pro-Am class. On Sunday, however, the duo retired early.

British GT Championship: Century Motorsport wins with the BMW M4 GT4 EVO at Oulton Park.

Fans witnessed two dramatic races in the British GT Championship on Monday at Oulton Park (GBR). Branden Templeton and Chris Salkeld (both GBR) claimed their first win of the season in the #14 BMW M4 GT4 EVO from Century Motorsport after previously scoring two second-place finishes. They won the GT4 Silver class in the first race and took third overall among the GT4 cars. In the second race, which saw some rain-related chaos, they finished second in their class and returned to the podium.

Things took a dramatic turn on Monday for their teammates Ravi Ramyead and Charlie Robertson (both GBR) in the #71 BMW M4 GT4 EVO. After a win and a second-place finish earlier in the season, they arrived at Oulton Park as GT4 class leaders. In the first race, Ramyead built a solid lead in the GT4 field – but then suffered a heavy crash into the barriers. The good news was that Ramyead was uninjured. Unfortunately, the #71 was too badly damaged to compete in the second race of the day.

In the GT4 drivers’ standings of the British GT Championship, Ramyead and Robertson now sit in second place after four races, directly followed by Templeton/Salkeld in third.

# The all-new BMW 1 Series, now available in Singapore.
## Sporty, agile handling, and a dynamic charisma.
Date: 2025-01-09 | Author: Kimberley Ng BMW Group | ID: T0447339EN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Singapore. BMW Asia today announced the availability of the all-new BMW 1 Series. 20 years since its introduction, the pioneer of driving pleasure in the premium compact segment is sharpening its sporty profile with a dynamic design presence, completely revised drive portfolio and extensively improved chassis technology. Since 2004, more than 3 million units of the BMW 1 Series have been delivered to customers. The fourth generation of the BMW 1 Series is produced at BMW Group Plant Leipzig.

“The all-new BMW 1 Series is modern, innovative and striking in equal measure,” said Lars Nielsen, Managing Director, BMW Group Asia. “Just months after the launch of the head-turning BMW M135 xDrive, we are completing our premium compact portfolio with the all-new BMW 116 M Sport. Its Category A COE placement makes it the ideal choice for hatchback fans to zip around in, and we are excited to wow our customers with the car’s driving prowess and advanced digital features.”

Typical BMW proportions in a compact format.

The dimensions of the five-door model have changed only slightly compared to its predecessor. The exterior length of the all-new BMW 1 Series has increased by 42 millimetres. The vehicle width is 1,800 millimetres, while the height has increased by 25 millimetres to 1,459 millimetres. Despite its compact dimensions, the all-new BMW 1 Series, based on a modern front-wheel drive architecture, offers generous space for up to five passengers and their luggage.

Silhouette with dynamic wedge shape, powerful rear.

The side view of the all-new BMW 1 Series is also characterized by clearly defined surfaces. The long bonnet, the forward-leaning BMW radiator grille, the sweeping roofline, and the flat side window graphics that taper towards the rear create a dynamic wedge shape. The all-new BMW 1 Series comes with M high-gloss Shadow Line as standard. The black side window surround also features a graphic element with the embossed number 1 in the area of the Hofmeister kink counter-swing on the C-pillar. A long roof spoiler and side air deflectors also contribute to the stretched silhouette.

With its strikingly flat front end, the all-new BMW 1 Series sits significantly lower to the road than its predecessor, underlining its sporty character. The headlights, which are set above the BMW radiator grille and extend well into the wheel arches, show the brand’s typical four-eyed face in a modern interpretation. Two vertical, slightly arrow-shaped LED units provide the position and daytime running lights and turn indicators. Adaptive LED headlights with glare-free matrix high beam are available as standard. They also feature blue accents and a cornering light function.

The exhaust tailpipes of all model variants are invisibly integrated into the rear apron. The flat rear lights protrude into both the luggage compartment lid and the side section, highlighting the widely flared rear wheel arches. The design of the light sources inside the headlights is echoed by vertically aligned LED elements for the rear light and turn indicators.The paint finishes for the all-new BMW 1 Series include two solid colours and seven metallic colours.

Dynamic appearance with M Sport Package and M Sport Design.

The standard M Sport Package makes the all-new BMW 1 Series even more dynamic. The unique exterior design features include a front apron with extra-large air intakes, M specific side skirts and a particularly powerful rear apron with a three-dimensional diffuser element. In addition, the front, side, and rear sections are linked by a black body surround, giving the car a particularly flat and road-hugging appearance from all angles. 18-inch M light alloy wheels with a Y-spoke design are standard.

Interior and equipment: Progressive cockpit, clean design, high-quality feel.

The centrepiece of the progressive cockpit design is the BMW Curved Display. It serves as the stage for the new BMW iDrive based on the BMW Operating [ADDRESS]. The number of buttons and controls on the instrument panel and centre console has been significantly reduced through the consistent digitalization of the display and operating system. The control panel between the driver and front passenger, including the gear selector, has also been redesigned.

New seats, generous space, modern functionality.

The all-new BMW 1 Series offers generous space for up to five passengers with easy access and generous legroom in the rear. The newly designed seats offer optimized lateral support and a high level of long-distance comfort. Electric seat adjustments, including memory on the driver’s side are available as standard. With the exception of the seat depth and headrest height, which are adjusted manually, all adjustments can be made from an integrated control panel.

The rear seat backrest can be split and folded down 40:20:40 as standard, to adapt the luggage space to the customer’s needs. As a result, the storage capacity under the high-swinging tailgate can be increased from 380 litres to up to 1,200 litres.

The standard M Sport Package includes sport seats with Veganza upholstery in four different colour choices or M Alcantara and Veganza combination in black with blue accents. The M Sport Package includes an M leather steering wheel with a distinctive three-spoke design and shift paddles.

Automatic air conditioning with digital control via BMW iDrive.

The standard automatic air conditioning in the all-new BMW 1 Series is fully integrated into BMW iDrive. It is fully digitalized and controlled by touching the Control Display or using voice control. The outer seam vents of the air conditioning system are integrated into a distinctive trim element that closes off the instrument panel on both sides. Ventilation is provided by discreetly integrated air vents in the centre of the cockpit. New control knobs allow the intensity and direction of airflow to be adjusted by turning and tilting.

In conjunction with the M Sport Package, the instrument panel next to the BMW Curved Display features diagonal stitching in the colours of BMW M GmbH. In addition to the M leather steering wheel and sport seats in Veganza and the corresponding interior surfaces, the specific design features of the M Sport Package for the interior also include an anthracite roof liner, M specific displays on the information display, an M pedal set, and interior trims in aluminium hexacube matt.

Extended standard equipment, wide range of customization options.

The standard interior lighting package for the all-new BMW 1 Series includes waterfall lighting for the centre console and indirect lighting in the door trim area. At the front, the intensity and colour of the footwell lighting can be individually adjusted, and the lighting mood can also be varied in the instrument panel area.

The latest generation of BMW TwinPower Turbo technology.

A completely revised drive portfolio forms the basis for the increased dynamics and efficiency of the new generation of the all-new BMW 1 Series. The highly efficient petrol engine available for the all-new BMW 1 Series is part of the latest generation of the Efficient Dynamics engine family. All engines in the all-new BMW 1 Series are combined with the latest version of the 7-speed dual-clutch transmission Steptronic as standard and transmit their power to the road via the front wheels. With a maximum power output of 90 kW/122 hp, the drive system of the all-new BMW 116 with its three-cylinder petrol engine accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h in 9.8 seconds.

Chassis technology and driving experience: Consistently optimized agility and comfort.

The chassis technology in the all-new BMW 1 Series, which has undergone extensive development compared to the predecessor model, ensures the driving pleasure typical of the brand in the premium compact segment. The agility, steering precision, and cornering dynamics of the all-new BMW 1 Series benefit from the increased rigidity of the body structure and the chassis connection. The front end also features a strut brace in the engine compartment and particularly solid axle mounts.

A large number of other innovations contribute to the consistent optimization of ride comfort as well as sporty handling. These include the increased tyre diameter line, which also enhances the visual presence of the all-new BMW 1 Series. The caster of the front wheels has been increased by 20 per cent to ensure optimum steering feedback and particularly stable directional stability. New shock absorber technology enhances ride comfort by reducing body roll during dynamic cornering. In addition, a centrally positioned pendulum support for the engine mounts optimizes acoustic comfort in the all-new BMW 1 Series.

With directly controlled wheel slip limitation and the integrated braking system, the new model generation features innovative systems that deliver a superior driving experience. The standard M Sport Package for the all-new BMW 1 Series includes the Adaptive M Chassis with lowered suspension and sport steering.

Front and rear axle feature newly developed components.

Highly preloaded anti-roll bar mounts are used at both front and rear. They help to improve body support when cornering, while at the same time improving ride comfort. They also increase steering precision. The front and rear axles feature heavy-duty wheel bearings with a weight and friction-optimised design to improve the car’s efficiency.

Optimized front axle kinematics promote agile steering and a steering feel that is largely unaffected by driving forces. The supports for the hydro mounts, which are now made of aluminium, reduce the car’s weight by around three kilograms. In addition to the hydro mount supports, the front axle support has also been redesigned to optimise impact energy absorption and occupant protection in the event of a collision.

The design principle of the rear axle makes a significant contribution to the increased driving dynamics potential of the all-new BMW 1 Series. Their model-specific design provides extra rigidity, combined with a rigidly connected rear axle support, to ensure precise wheel guidance with high lateral acceleration. In addition, the more compartmentalised arrangement of springs and dampers means less space is required. This has a positive effect on the amount of space available and the comfort of the passengers in the rear.

Ride comfort in the all-new BMW 1 Series is enhanced by a newly designed suspension and damping system. The central innovation is the stroke dependent additional damping on the front axle. This is generated by means of an additional sleeve on the shock absorber and ensures that the body is stabilized when driving over small bumps and that the transition into bends is excellent. Both front and rear suspension is tuned to the weight of the respective model variant. The conventional suspension springs are supplemented by progressive springs. A three-way support bearing transfers the force of the main and auxiliary springs directly to the body. This decouples the shock absorbers, allowing their rubber mounts to be designed independently of the vehicle’s load and preload, and optimizing ride and acoustic comfort.

Extensive safety equipment.

The all-new BMW 1 Series offers a comprehensive package for optimized safety as standard with the Driving Assistant. This is ensured in particular by the advanced front collision warning system. It includes Collision Warning, pedestrian, and cyclist warning with braking function, and Crossroads Warning. Other standard comfort and safety features include Cruise Control with brake function, Speed Limit Info, Traffic Sign Recognition with No Overtaking Display and Route-ahead Assistant, Manual speed Limit Assist, emergency steering intervention, Lane Departure Warning with lane return, Rear Collision Warning, and Exit Warning.

The standard Parking Assistant enables automatic parking and reversing in both on and off-street parking spaces. It also includes Active Park Distance Control with front and rear sensors, a rear view camera, Reversing Assistant, and trailer assistant.

Display and control system, connectivity: Innovative user experience with the BMW Operating [ADDRESS] and BMW Digital Premium.

The latest version of the BMW iDrive display and operating system with QuickSelect is now available in the all-new BMW 1 Series. Based on the BMW Operating [ADDRESS], it offers optimized options for intuitive and convenient control of numerous functions and for the use of innovative digital services. With the BMW Curved Display and the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant, the new BMW iDrive is consistently geared towards operation via touch functions and natural speech. The operating system also includes multifunction buttons on the steering wheel.

BMW iDrive with QuickSelect. Fast and direct access to the functions you want.

The standard BMW Curved Display in the all-new BMW 1 Series also offers a modern interpretation of the cockpit design with the typical BMW driver focus. It consists of a 10.25-inch Information Display and a 10.7-inch Control Display. The Control Display’s new home screen permanently displays the navigation system’s map view or other individually configurable displays. On the same level, the driver’s side of the screen features vertical widgets that can be swiped through. QuickSelect enables functions to be accessed directly without having to switch to a submenu. Additional information and settings can be accessed by swiping horizontally across the widget.

BMW Digital Premium from the BMW ConnectedDrive Store.

With BMW ConnectedDrive Upgrades, customers can also test selected functions free of charge for a period of one month and then book them for a specific term. The highlight of the programme in the BMW ConnectedDrive Store is the BMW Digital Premium offer. As part of a subscription, customers can use all the apps available in their country, for example from the areas of music streaming, video streaming, news, or games in the vehicle. BMW Digital Premium also includes data usage for all digital services and apps from the BMW ConnectedDrive Store, including music and video streaming.

The cloud-based BMW Maps navigation system is also part of the BMW Live Cockpit Plus, which comes as standard in the all-new BMW 1 Series. It is easy to use and provides fast, dynamic route planning.

Optimized dialogue with the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant.

The latest version of the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant responds to naturally spoken instructions and has continuously expanded its capabilities. In order to optimise the dialogue between the driver and the vehicle, interactive graphics are shown on the Control Display which, for example, signal the attention of the digital companion and display appropriate symbols in response to selected voice commands. For example, the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant responds to the request to find the nearest petrol station with an image of a petrol pump.

Optimum networking: Smartphone integration, 5G mobile phone antennas, BMW ID, and My BMW App.

The standard equipment of the all-new BMW 1 Series includes optimized smartphone integration via Apple CarPlay® and Android Auto™. The services are integrated directly in the display and operating system via a Wi-Fi connection between the respective smartphone and the vehicle. The all-new BMW 1 Series comes with 5G mobile reception as standard.

To personalise the user experience with BMW ID, simply log in to the vehicle for the first time using a smartphone and scan the QR code. The personal profile is then added and synchronisable settings are loaded. Functioning as a universal digital interface, the My BMW App provides information on the vehicle’s status at all times. It also provides remote access to functions such as locating the vehicle and locking and unlocking the doors.

The Telephony with Wireless Charging option allows compatible smartphones to be charged wirelessly in a storage compartment in the front of the centre console, which is significantly larger and now also cooled compared to the predecessor model.

Owings Mills. The 2021 BMW Championship was a thrilling tournament that culminated in a spectacular six-hole playoff and a victory for Patrick Cantlay (USA). Four years later, the six-time “PGA TOUR Tournament of the Year” returns to Caves Valley Golf Club, once again promising excellent golf and a unique event experience.

The top 50 players of this year's PGA TOUR are vying for just 30 tickets to next week’s season finale. A golf tournament can hardly be more star-studded and competitive. The outstanding field is spearheaded by world number one player Scottie Scheffler (USA), Rory McIlroy (NIR), who this year at the Masters became only the sixth golfer in history to complete the career Grand Slam, last year’s winner Keegan Bradley (USA), and “Caves Valley defending champion” Cantlay. The only Top-10 player missing from the world rankings is Austria’s Sepp Straka, who had to withdraw for family reasons.

No less star-studded was the Gardner Heidrick Pro-Am, which traditionally kicks off the BMW Championship on Wednesday. Pop superstars the Jonas Brothers first demonstrated their skills with a golf club before thrilling the Pro-Am guests in the evening with an exclusive live concert.

All profits from the sale of Pro-Am spots – as well as all proceeds from the tournament – benefit the Evans Scholars Foundation (ESF), a foundation of tournament host Western Golf Association. The ESF awards college tuition and housing scholarships for inspiring young caddies from across the country. Since 2007, the BMW Championship has raised more than $60 million in support of the Evans Scholars Foundation, helping award more than 4,000 full tuition and housing college scholarships to caddies. On Monday, the new “Caves Valley Golf Club Evans Scholarship House” was inaugurated at the University of Maryland in the presence of [EXECUTIVE_OFFICER], Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, People and Places. The facility will provide up to 38 additional caddies with the opportunity to study tuition-free and live on campus in the future.

BMW will once again contribute an additional full four-year Evans Scholarship in the name of the first PGA TOUR player to record a hole-in-one on any hole during tournament play. This has happened six times so far in the history of the BMW Championship. The first player to ace the par-three 17th hole will walk away with the keys to the all-new 100% electric performance SUV BMW iX M70. BMW Owners in attendance can witness the thrill of this tantalizing par-three challenge firsthand at the BMW Owners’ Pavilion hospitality venue overlooking the 17 th hole and 18 th tee. Premium parking options are also available for BMW owners.

All guests are invited to join BMW for a variety of activities in between the action on the fairways and greens. Located by the main entrance, the BMW Fan Experience features a unique Skee-Ball style chipping challenge. On display is an exhibition of BMW models curated by PGA TOUR pros. Guests can recharge in comfort at the Baltimore Biergarten area and practice their short game with the Baltimore-themed Long Putt Challenge surrounded by BMWs displayed in the colors of the Baltimore flag. Ryder Cup-themed BMW vehicles will also be showcased. The legendary team competition ([ADDRESS]–28, 2025, Bethpage Black Course near New York, USA), which BMW supports as a Worldwide Partner, also plays a sporting role at the BMW Championship. After the tournament, we will now which six U.S. players are qualified for Captain Keegan Bradley's team.

Hosted by the Western Golf Association, the BMW Championship is the oldest non-major on the PGA TOUR schedule, dating back to 1899 when it debuted as the Western Open. Not only in terms of sporting value and tradition, the BMW Championship is on par with the majors. This was underscored by the event being named “PGA TOUR Tournament of the Year” for the sixth time after 2008, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2023 last year.

# Amaya Suberviola wins 40th edition of the Premio BMW de Pintura. BMW Group celebrates four decades of art, culture and commitment in Spain.
## Navarran artist Amaya Suberviola has won the 40th Premio BMW de Pintura for her work "ST25061 (Coger una pestaña con los dedos)" (Catching an eyelash with your fingers). In the Digital Art category, the award went to Madrid-based Chino Moya for his audiovisual piece "Metapope".

Madrid/Munich. Navarran artist Amaya Suberviola has won the 40th Premio BMW de Pintura for her work "ST25061 (Coger una pestaña con los dedos)" (Catching an eyelash with your fingers) . In the Digital Art category, the award went to Madrid-based Chino Moya for his audiovisual piece "Metapope" .

With this edition, the Premio BMW de Pintura celebrates four decades of uninterrupted commitment to culture and artistic talent, consolidating its position as one of the most prestigious competitions in Europe. Since its creation in 1986, the award has advanced the careers of more than 29,000 artists, helping to strengthen the ties between business, art and society.

"Art is a driver of transformation in thinking, and culture is an essential tool for the development of societies," said [EXECUTIVE_OFFICER] , Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG , during his speech. "Our support for art is not an isolated gesture, but a global commitment that seeks to build bridges between creativity, innovation and corporate citizenship."

For his part, Manuel Terroba , Executive President of the BMW Group for Spain and Portugal , emphasised that "having reached forty editions is living proof that art and innovation, tradition and modernity, can go hand in hand." He added that "the BMW Painting Prize has evolved with the times, opening up to new forms of expression such as digital art and becoming a showcase for diversity, innovation and excellence."

A gala celebrating art The Teatro Real in Madrid was the venue for a gala presided over by Her Majesty Queen Sofía , at which more than 1,300 guests from the cultural, artistic and social spheres celebrated the 40th anniversary of this award. The BMW Group paid an emotional tribute to Her Majesty for her constant support of culture and the arts, as well as her commitment to social and humanitarian causes.

The BMW Group also paid tribute to Her Royal Highness Princess Irene of Greece , whose work at the helm of the Mundo en Armonía Foundation began at the same time as the Premio BMW de Pintura was created, in a clear commitment to bringing together art, culture and solidarity with the most disadvantaged.

In the same vein, and following the cessation of the Mundo en Armonía Foundation's activities last year, the BMW Group will donate the proceeds from the 40th Premio BMW de Pintura Gala to the Food Bank, with the aim of alleviating the vulnerability experienced by children.

Forty years of culture: a journey through Spanish creativity Actor and BMW ambassador Álex González hosted the gala and, from the stage, highlighted the cultural significance of this anniversary: "Forty years of Spanish history, of the evolution of our habits, our customs and our ways of seeing, living and creating. Because culture is not a luxury: it is a necessity. It is the soul of a people. It is what unites us when everything seems to divide us," he said.

Under this premise, the gala featured a musical show with the participation of the RTVE Symphony Orchestra , conducted by Salvador Vázquez , together with the Dúo del Valle, Antonio Najarro and José Mercé , who took an emotional journey through Spanish creation over the last four decades, from Falla to Manuel Alejandro, culminating in a performance of "Se nos rompió el amor" in tribute to Rocío Jurado.

The artist Alaska , responsible for one of the most acclaimed performances of the night, recalled her experiences and the cultural effervescence of 1980s Spain, the era in which the award was born, and defended the value of creativity as a hallmark of identity: "La Movida did not end in the 1980s. It is revived every time an artist dares to challenge the status quo, and every time Spain reinvents itself. Because creativity here is not taught, it is breathed," she said.

Art as a universal language This year's jury — made up of Antonio López, Miguel Zugaza, Patrizia Sandretto Re Rebaudengo, Guillermo Solana and Lucía Casani — selected the winners from among almost 2,000 artists of 38 nationalities, consolidating the Premio BMW de Pintura as a window onto the world and creative diversity.

The finalists in the painting category were José Ramón Amondarain Ubarrechena, Taxio Ardanaz Ruiz, Igor Arrieta Varela, Marta Beltrán Ferrer, Cristina Mejías Gómez, Simón Sepúlveda Braithwaite, and An Wei Lu Li .

In digital art, the finalists were Juan Carlos Bracho Jiménez, Amaya Hernández Sigüenza and Elisa Villota Sádaba .

Exhibition at Conde Duque All the finalists' works from the 40th edition will be on display for the first time at the Conde Duque Cultural Centre in Madrid from 20 November 2025 to the end of January 2026 .

Throughout its 40-year history, the BMW Painting Award has recognised artists such as Florencio Maíllo, Rafa Macarrón, Ángeles Agrela, Miki Leal, Santiago Ydáñez, Sonia Navarro and Damaris Pan, who have found in this competition a decisive boost to their careers. Forty years later, the award continues to be a celebration of talent, creativity, and the transformative power of art.

Motorists ‘lose’ up to 565 hours of their lives to car-related admin and maintenance planning. A poll of 2,000 drivers, of all vehicle makes and models, revealed that on average, they spend the equivalent of a full day each year thinking about service schedules, MOTs, and potential issues - time that could be better spent elsewhere. [ADDRESS] in 10 (63 per cent) have missed important occasions because they couldn’t get there due to a car-related problem. In fact, drivers reported having to change plans an average of four times a year due to undetected car issues. The research was commissioned by BMW, whose Proactive Care service is designed to give drivers added confidence and convenience, working quietly in the background to help keep them moving with greater peace of mind. Available on every BMW less than 10 years old, the technology uses real-time vehicle data to alert drivers to potential issues before they become problems, remind them about scheduled maintenance, or offer immediate support following an accident.

# PHANTOM AT 100: A SILENT WITNESS TO A CENTURY OF ART
## Rolls-Royce has been associated with the greatest names in contemporary art since its foundation. Masters including Salvador Dalí, Andy Warhol, Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, Christian ‘Bébé’ Bérard and Cecil Beaton all travelled by Rolls-Royce. However, it is Phantom, the marque’s pinnacle product which celebrates its centenary in 2025, that is most closely linked to the art world.

“[ADDRESS] years, the Rolls-Royce Phantom has moved in the same circles as the world’s leading artists. As a symbol of self-expression, Phantom has often featured in incidents of creative significance – many of them defining moments of the last decade. As we mark Phantom’s centenary, it is the perfect time to reflect on this motor car’s endlessly intriguing legacy and the artistic personalities who played a role in shaping its story.” Chris Brownridge, Chief Executive, Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Rolls-Royce has been associated with the greatest names in contemporary art since its foundation. Masters including Salvador Dalí, Andy Warhol, Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, Christian ‘Bébé’ Bérard and Cecil Beaton all travelled by Rolls-Royce. Dame Laura Knight, the first woman elected to full membership of the Royal Academy of Arts, even used a Rolls-Royce as a mobile studio, painting from its interior at racecourses such as Epsom and Ascot. The world’s most notable collectors, too, were drawn to the brand, among them Jacquelyn de Rothschild, Peggy Guggenheim and Nelson Rockefeller. However, it is Phantom, the marque’s pinnacle product which celebrates its centenary in 2025, that is most closely linked to the art world. Over eight generations and 100 years, this motor car has been owned by some of the most famous creatives in modern history. Phantom itself has been exhibited in galleries around the world as an artwork in its own right – from institutional collections, such as London’s Saatchi Gallery and the Smithsonian Design Museum in New York, to countless independent galleries and exhibition spaces.

# Turning old into new: Recycling as next step towards greater circular economy for BMW Group 3D printing.
## +++ New 3D printing material from waste powder and used parts +++ Additive Manufacturing Campus supplies recycled filament and printing parameter package to BMW Group sites +++
Date: 2025-07-17 | Author: Benedikt Torka BMW Group | ID: T0451410EN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Munich. The BMW Group uses plastic wire (filament) and granulate from waste 3D printing powder and used parts to produce new components using the 3D printing technology. Waste powder generated from production of thousands of components each year and previously been disposed of, along with shredded used parts, is now processed into new filament. The filament is rolled onto spools like wire, which can then be used to print new items, such as auxiliary production devices and tools. This filament is used at the Additive Manufacturing Campus in Oberschleißheim, as well as at various sites across the BMW Group's global production network. In addition to recycled filament for the Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) process, the Campus also provides recycled granulate for use in Fused Granulate Fabrication (FGF) technology, thus enabling manufacturing of large tools. “I’ve been involved with this project from the very beginning and I’m thrilled to see how far we’ve come – from our initial ideas and attempts at startup level to now being able to produce large quantities of highly robust components from recycled filament at any BMW Group production location. It’s incredibly exciting to continuously develop and test new processes. The use of waste powder and discarded 3D printing components is a key element of a functional and efficient circular economy,” says Paul Victor Osswald, project manager for Predevelopment Non-Metals, who has worked on this development since 2018. First steps taken in 2018 with innovative “bottleUP” project The foundation for today’s 3D printing loop at the BMW Group was first established in 2018. As part of the BMW Start-up Accelerator programme, the innovative “bottleUP” project focused on obtaining 3D printing material for various applications by recycling PET bottles. Just one year later, the first industrial waste was being used to produce recycled filament on a pilot basis. By 2021, Osswald’s team successfully printed the first holders and auxiliary production devices using their own recycled filament. Today, various locations across the BMW Group’s global production network are supplied with 3D-printed components from the Additive Manufacturing Campus in Oberschleißheim, where the company has consolidated its production, research and training activities in additive manufacturing under one roof. Each year, up to 12 tonnes of waste powder can be recycled into filament and granulate and can then be reused for the manufacture of auxiliary production devices in the plants and for pre-development projects at the Additive Manufacturing Campus. The use of these components reduces costs, enhances process efficiency and product quality, and improves ergonomics for employees at the plants. Additive Manufacturing Campus supports production sites with comprehensive package of recycled filament, printing parameters and expertise As part of the BMW Group’s centre of competence concept, the Additive Manufacturing Campus facilitates the ongoing rollout of its in-house developed recycling filament. It enables locations by sharing expertise and providing comprehensive solutions. In collaboration with established and experienced 3D printing facilities at BMW Group production plants, suitable 3D printers are tested, and optimised printing parameters for the recycled filament are developed and validated for the respective models. This package – consisting of printer recommendations, recycled filament and validated parameter settings – is then made available to other plants. This ensures that locations are efficiently enabled and can quickly achieve high-quality printing results on site. The Campus provides further support by building know-how at the plants through relevant skills development and training opportunities. This includes foundational courses in 3D printing, advanced training on the topic of design for additive manufacturing and application-focused sessions on integrating 3D printing into the production environment. A strong and constantly evolving network has developed across the sites, benefiting from knowledge-sharing and mutual support. The next 3D printing facility, which is currently under construction at Plant Debrecen in Hungary, will benefit from the network’s experience and will support the new production plant for the Neue Klasse going forward.

Phillip Island. The first races of the 2025 FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) are in the books. The Australian Phillip Island season opener turned out to be a rollercoaster of emotions for BMW Motorrad Motorsport and the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team. On Saturday, defending World Champion Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR) finished second in the first race of the year, securing a podium finish. However, Sunday proved to be a challenging day for ‘El Turco’ and his teammate Michael van der Mark (NED).

The team arrived in Australia after a demanding final phase of pre-season preparation. Due to a regulation change, the new BMW M 1000 RR, which had been developed for racing over the winter, had to be adapted. Additionally, Razgatlioglu sustained a finger injury in January. BMW Motorrad Motorsport and the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team took advantage of WorldSBK’s two-day test on Monday and Tuesday before the race weekend to fine-tune the optimal set-up for the Phillip Island Grand Prix Circuit. After a crash on Monday, Razgatlioglu sat out the remainder of the first day but returned to testing on Tuesday.

Following Friday’s free practice sessions, the action got serious on Saturday. Razgatlioglu marked his return to the front row with P2 in Superpole qualifying, while van der Mark secured seventh place. The two BMW factory riders were the only ones able to challenge a dominant line-up of Ducati riders in Superpole and the races. In the first of the two main races, which both featured a mandatory pit stop for a tyre change, Razgatlioglu remained among the front runners from the start and ultimately finished second, with only Nicolò Bulega (ITA / Ducati) ahead of him. Van der Mark worked his way into the top five but unfortunately crashed out.

Sunday kicked off with the short Superpole race, which saw a moment of drama in the first lap when Razgatlioglu nearly crashed and ran straight into the gravel. He rejoined at the back of the field and launched a comeback, making his way up to P13. Van der Mark initially surged to third place but later encountered issues, crossing the finish line in 14th. That meant the duo started the final main race from tenth and 12th on the grid. Razgatlioglu gained multiple positions in the opening laps, breaking into the top five before the pit stop. However, after changing tyres, he had to return to the pits again due to a technical issue, forcing him to retire from the race. The cause of the problem is still under investigation. Van der Mark fought hard, but P14 was the most he could achieve.

WorldSBK now returns to Europe, with the second round taking place on the last weekend of March in Portimão, Portugal. BMW Motorrad Motorsport will use the break to analyse the first races, continue working hard, and prepare for the long European leg of the season.

Reactions after the Phillip Island season opener.

Sven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “When we arrived at Phillip Island it was clear that it would not be an easy weekend for us because we just missed testing time with all the obstacles we had over winter. With Toprak’s finger injury, he missed a lot of testing time, we had a lot of rainy days as well and there has been the concession topic so we came to Phillip Island still investigating the best direction for our set-up. I think on Saturday we showed potential but Sunday was definitely a tough day for us. It is something we will focus on now and we will get back stronger together at Portimão. We had a good test there so we are confident that we can have a better weekend. The most important thing is that we now have a couple of weeks at home to really go deep into the analysis, then we test again and I am sure we will come back stronger. We just have to find our sweet spot for the bike. This weekend showed that there is potential. Sometimes we found the right way and sometimes we were struggling. It is part of the game. From being the hunter to be being the hunted it was clear that it will not be easier than last year but we take on the challenge. We finished this first weekend not as we would have liked to, but now we are for sure looking forward to Portimão.”

Christian Gonschor, Technical Director BMW Motorrrad Motorsport: “It was a very intense week with many ups and downs, a mix of light and shadow. However, we learned a lot, which means we can now head to Portimão with plenty of valuable information. There, we will first test before the second round of the season takes place. During Monday and Tuesday’s Phillip Island test we gathered a lot of insights for the race weekend, learned a great deal about the bike, and I think Toprak’s Superpole time showed that the performance of the motorcycle is still there. This year, it is a bit more difficult to fully maximise it, but both riders delivered a strong performance in the first main race. Toprak’s podium was, of course, the highlight of the weekend, and Mickey had a very strong race pace until his high-speed crash, which he fortunately walked away from unharmed. That is what we take away from this weekend. The bike has the performance, and the areas where we still need to fine-tune the balance will now be worked on at home and during the test in Portimão.”

Toprak Razgatlioglu, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “I am never very happy after the first races of the season which has been the case in the past years – the season opener is always strange. To get the podium in race one was not easy; thanks to my team as in every session they improved the bike. I felt a bit better on the bike in that race and we did a very good job. At the start of the Superpole race, I had a big problem and was lucky not to hit someone and to avoid a big crash. For race two we said it would be better to ride yesterday’s bike because I felt that we had been really improving and the grip was much better than before but during the race there was a problem and I could not continue. But I now only focus on the next race. Finally we are going to Europe and I’m just starting to fight with all the Ducatis because this is almost like a Ducati Cup. Nicolò Bulega was strong here last year, so I was not surprised that he was fast. Congratulations to him, he did a very good job and deserves it. I think that we will fight more this year. Álvaro Bautista is also strong, but this year, all Ducatis were in front. This is not normal and I hope that it will not continue like this. Now we have a long break of almost one month and we will work hard and try to come back stronger. We have a test at Portimão and these two test days are really important because we try to improve the bike. We are still not at hundred percent but I know that everyone is pushing hard.”

Michael van der Mark, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “Honestly, this week has been a bit disappointing. We’ve been testing a lot, we tried a lot of things but we never really got a nice feeling with the bike. It has been very strange because we really tried everything. Then on Saturday, when the temperature was very high, I did a good lap in Superpole and managed to qualify in seventh position so that was positive. In race one, when we had very high temperatures, I was doing very well. I was enjoying it and the bike felt very good so I was confident but unfortunately I crashed out and for some reason on Sunday we did not have any good feeling at all. We have to find out why the bike felt so different on Sunday. Now we are going back to Europe, we have a two-day test at Portimão and it’s good that we can do a lot of testing there and make sure that we can do a lot better at Portimão.”

# Forward momentum through technology openness, strong product line-up and NEUE KLASSE: BMW Group on track for growth in 2025
## +++ 2025: Slight Growth planned in sales volume +++ Group EBT targeted at previous year’s level +++ Higher Free cash flow expected +++ Slight Increase of BEV share in total sales planned +++ Due to a consistent strategy: Investments set to decrease from planned peak in 2024 +++ Technology openness as strategic competitive advantage +++ First NEUE KLASSE production vehicle will be the BMW iX3 +++
Date: 2025-03-17 | Author: Britta Ullrich BMW Group | ID: T0448943EN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Munich. The BMW Group is entering the financial year 2025 with a clear commitment to growth – with a planned slight increase in sales volume, a decrease in investments and robust free cash flow.

“What has always set the BMW Group apart is our ability to maintain our course, even in challenging conditions. We remain clearly focused on two things – our near term performance and our long-term perspective,” said [EXECUTIVE_OFFICER], Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG , on Friday. “With the NEUE KLASSE, we are implementing the biggest future-focused project in the history of our company, while at the same time achieving a robust free cash flow.”

At the end of this year, the first production model of the NEUE KLASSE , the new BMW iX3 , will kick off an unprecedented ramp-up of new models: Across all drivetrain variants and all segments, the BMW Group will release more than 40 new and updated vehicles onto the market by 2027 . What these new models have in common is that they will be equipped with future technology clusters, which will be rolled out successively across the entire portfolio with the launch of the NEUE KLASSE.

“We are taking a huge leap forward with our new technology clusters – achieving maximum scalability, increasing the level of innovation and enhancing customer benefits. We do not differentiate between segments or drivetrain technologies – we provide every customer with the latest technology,” said Zipse .

Consistent implementation of strategy

The BMW Group made extensive investments in innovative technologies, its model line-up and manufacturing footprint worldwide in 2024. There will be a decrease in expenditure this year, from the planned peak in R&D spending and capital expenditure last year. On this basis, the company is aiming for a profit before taxes at the previous year’s level – despite increased tariffs.

“Never before in the history of BMW have we invested so extensively in our future. Investment reached its highest level in 2024, as planned. This underlines the durability of our strategy – and how consistently we are implementing it,” said Walter Mertl, member of the Board of Management, Finance .

Technology openness as strategic success factor in global competition

The diversity of its product range remains a key success factor for the BMW Group: The company is well positioned to meet globally diverse requirements and customer needs – both today and in the future – with a broad drivetrain portfolio spanning internal combustion engines, plug-in hybrids, battery-electric drive trains and, starting in 2028, also fuel-cell electric vehicles powered by hydrogen.

Highly efficient internal combustion engines , which remain in high demand worldwide, will continue to play a key role. Last year alone, the company released more than 15 new or updated models with internal combustion engines onto the roads. All engines have been approved for higher percentages of renewable fuels for years . Fuels with lower CO 2 content are the most effective way to reduce the carbon footprint of the existing fleet of over 250 million vehicles in Europe alone, making a valuable contribution to the transport sector’s efforts in the fight against climate change.

Battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) remain the BMW Group’s main growth driver . The company’s broad all-electric offer comprises more than 15 models across all brands . This means the BMW Group has a fully-electric offer in all its main segments. In 2024, the BMW Group significantly increased its total BEV sales worldwide to 426,536 units (+13.5%), representing a sales share of more than 17%. At MINI, about one in four vehicles is fully-electric; at Rolls-Royce, it is already one in three.

Plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) also remain an essential element of the BMW Group’s technology-open approach and electrification of its model range: State-of-the-art BMW PHEV models enable an all-electric range of over 100 kilometres, thus making it relevant for a large proportion of typical driving situations and also making a substantial contribution to CO 2 reduction. In total, the BMW Groupdelivered nearly 600,000 electrified vehicles including plug-in hybrids (PHEVs and BEVs) to customers in 2024. This means almost one in four vehicles sold was electrified .

Electrified deliveries reach new all-time high – important milestones in 2025

The company will reach two major milestones in 2025: first, three million electrified vehicles on the roads since the launch of the BMW i3 and BMW i8 and, second, 1.5 million fully-electric vehicles delivered to customers.

The decrease in the CO 2 emissions of the new vehicle fleet also underlines the effectiveness of technology openness: Based on preliminary figures, the BMW Group was able to reduce its EU fleet emissions to below 100 grams of CO 2 per kilometre (WLTP) for the first time in 2024.

First hydrogen production vehicle to be released in 2028

In 2028, the BMW Group will become the first premium manufacturer worldwide to release a series production fuel-cell vehicle, offering its customers another emission-free drivetrain option. To this end, the BMW Group is deepening its cooperation with Toyota Motor Corporation: Both partners will jointly develop the drive system for passenger cars, which will then be used in a brand-specific way in the two manufacturers’ respective models. The planned BMW vehicle will fit seamlessly into the brand’s portfolio, where it will be available alongside other drive train options.

NEUE KLASSE is laying the foundation – BMW iX3 will be first production vehicle

Series production of the NEUE KLASSE will get underway in late 2025. The first production vehicle of this new generation of BMW models will have the model name BMW iX3 . Series production of this SAV model, which was foreshadowed by the BMW Vision Neue Klasse X last year, will begin late this year at Plant Debrecen – the first plant in the BMW Group production network to exclusively build fully-electric vehicles. Since late 2024, the plant has been producing pre-series vehicles for testing.

The BMW iX3 kicks off an unprecedented model ramp-up up to 2027 : The launches of more than 40 models of all drivetrain variants will follow in quick succession; including a sporty sedan that is core to the BMW brand, which will be launched in 2026.

With the series launch of the BMW iX3, the new technology clusters will also be integrated throughout the entire BMW product line-up based on the established modularity principle. With this development, the BMW Group has achieved a high level of innovation : Numerous patents were successfully registered – for example, for electric motor components, display projection technologies and driving dynamics control functions. This means that all future BMW models will benefit from the innovations of the NEUE KLASSE - as well as from the new design language .

Digital nervous system for “Software-Defined Vehicle”

For the next stage in its customer and driving experience, the BMW Group has completely redesigned the components, functionality and connectivity its “Software-Defined Vehicle”. The result is an entirely restructured digital nervous system – consisting of a new electrical system with zonal architecture, a refined software architecture and four “super-brains”. These high-performance computers cluster the computing power for key customer functionality around infotainment, automated driving, driving dynamics and basic functions, such as vehicle access, air conditioning and comfort. In this way, the BMW Group is centralising and significantly reducing the number of electronic control units, while simultaneously providing well over 20 times more in-car computing power in the vehicle. This already ensures that the electronic control units will also be capable of accommodating future software and function updates, including AI features.

The zonal architecture comprising four zones, will substantially increase the vehicle's efficiency: On the one hand, this radically simplifies the electrical system – 600 metres less wiring also reduces weight by 30%. On the other hand, the use of “smart eFuses” allows unnecessary energy consumption to be deactivated in certain situations, such as when the vehicle is parked or charging. Developers are working on well over 1,000 software modules with more than 500 million lines of code to further enhance the software architecture of the new digital “nervous system”.

Overall, the redesign of the electronics architecture enables a quantum leap in performance, integration capability and efficiency . New innovations can be relayed much faster to the vehicle through over-the-air upgrades, ensuring the car remains up-to-date – even when the next vehicle generation is already on the market. Over the course of the year, the BMW Group targets to increase the number of “over the air update” capable vehicles on the roads to over ten million.

Next-level driving experience

Ten times faster than previous systems, developed entirely in-house and delivering maximum integration – with the “Heart of Joy” and new “BMW Dynamic Performance Control ”, the BMW Group is set to achieve a quantum leap in driving experience : For the first time, the new highly integrated control unit – that will be used in every fully-electric BMW in the future – combines drivetrain and driving dynamics functions. Integrated control of the drive train, braking and recuperation takes efficiency to the next level: [ADDRESS]% of driving situations, the conventional brake does not need to intervene – the recuperation braking power is sufficient. As a result, the “Heart of Joy” increases overall efficiency by up to 25%.

The performance capabilities and potential of the “Heart of Joy” are showcased in the BMW Vision Driving Experience . In this new high-performance test vehicle, the functionality of the electronic control unit is tested under extreme conditions: The Vision Vehicle develops a torque of up to 18,000 Nm. The logic behind this: If the system can handle such a powerful high-performance vehicle, it will also be capable of managing the requirements of future production models. The BMW Vision Driving Experience will showcase the capabilities of the “Heart of Joy” in April at the Auto Shanghai 2025.

Focus on driver orientation: The new BMW Panoramic iDrive

More than 20 years ago, the BMW Group set the benchmark for driver orientation and intuitive operability with its iDrive system. Starting in the new BMW iX3, the company is taking the next step by launching a completely new display and a new highly intelligent operating system. The clear objective is to reinterpret the brand’s hallmark “hands on the wheel, eyes on the road” approach and develop it into the future.

With “BMW Panoramic iDrive”, the central interface for driver-vehicle interaction is being totally redesigned . At the heart of this new system is BMW Panoramic Vision – a completely newly-developed concept that projects content across the full width of the windscreen. It is rounded off by three other new components: the BMW 3D head-up display, the central display and the multifunction steering wheel. The entire system is operated either by touch or voice control via BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant, which is taken to a new level through a Large Language Model (LLM).

The intelligent backbone of the new Panoramic iDrive is formed by the new BMW Operating System X, which was developed entirely in-house and is based on an Android Open Source Project (AOSP) software stack, delivering significant update and upgrade capabilities. The new operating system enables optimal coordination and distribution of content in the vehicle across Panoramic iDrive’s four elements. At the same time, it offers customers maximum personalisation and customisation, tailored to their individual preferences and needs.

Sixth-generation BMW eDrive technology

The BMW Group is launching the sixth generation of its eDrive technology in the electric models of the NEUE KLASSE. The system comprises three significantly enhanced components: the high-voltage battery, the electric motor and the “BMW Energy Master”: The latter operates as the control unit for the entire electric drive system, has been developed completely in-house and will be manufactured in the BMW Group Plant in Landshut.

In the future, the BMW Group will use round cells and an 800-volt system for its high-voltage battery. This combination heralds a major breakthrough at both cell and vehicle levels: 20% higher energy density, 30% faster charging and at least 30% more range . The round cells are integrated and wired directly into the battery housing. With this new concept, the BMW Group is aiming to reduce costs for the high voltage battery by 40 to 50 percent.**

For its e-drive , the BMW Group relies on a highly flexible and scalable modular system . The basis for this is provided by DC-excited Synchronous Motors (SSMs) that are developed and produced in-house. Vehicles with xDrive come with the option of Asynchronous Motors (ASMs) installed on the front axle, reducing energy loss by 40% and weight by 10%. In the future, customers will be able to choose between models with one, two, three or four electric motors.

Strong brands, diversified product portfolio

The foundation of the BMW Group’s success lies in its fresh and attractive product line-up across all segments . In 2024, with the new BMW X3, the BMW brand unveiled the fourth generation of one of its best-selling models. Within the past two years, the BMW Group has thoroughly updated its product range in two high-volume segments : In the entry-level segment, the new generations of the BMW 1 Series and BMW 2 Series Gran Coupé were released onto the market. In BMW’s core segment, both the BMW 3 Series and BMW 4 Series were further developed. Following the update to the BMW iX*, this model now provides a fully-electric range of over 700 kilometres in the WLTP cycle.

In 2024, M GmbH posted record sales for the 13th consecutive year , building on its broad and diverse model line-up, including the BMW M3 CS Touring*, BMW M5 Sedan* and BMW M5 Touring*, among others. One in ten BMW brand vehicles features M technology.

With the launch of the new MINI Convertible*, the New MINI Family is now complete, comprising five models in total.

Rolls-Royce recently introduced its s econd fully-electric vehicle, Black Badge Spectre *. The company is also investing 300 million pounds in its Goodwood production site to further expand its Bespoke and Coachbuild offerings.

BMW Motorrad reported its highest-ever sales last year . This success can be attributed to its highly sought-after GS models, the new heritage models of the R12 series and the high-performance long-distance sports models from the four-cylinder series, among others.

As planned, future investments reach new all-time high in 2024

Systematically and with strong momentum, the BMW Group is working on extensive future model updates and technology innovations including electrification and digitalisation across all model series. To this end, the company invested more than € 18 billion in R&D and capital expenditure linked to new products and facilities in the 2024 financial year . The company will further strengthen its global production network with the construction of the new plant in Debrecen (Hungary) – where series production of the new BMW iX3 will begin at the end of this year – along with the development of five high voltage battery assembly facilities and the extensive refurbishment of the Munich plant.

BMW Group meets adjusted business targets for 2024, as forecast

As projected, the company achieved its adjusted business targets for 2024, which were set in September. The guidance adjustment was triggered by the financial effects of delivery stops and recalls in connection with the supplied Integrated Brake System (IBS) component and continuing subdued demand in the Chinese market. Outside of China, the BMW Group benefited from growing customer demand for its attractive premium vehicles: Excluding China, the BMW brand achieved growth of 4.1% for the full year and was able to expand its position as number one in the segment worldwide. The BMW Group reported revenues for the full year of € 142,380 million (2023: € 155,498 million; -8.4%).

Investment in the future reach a new high with NEUE KLASSE

Expenditure for research and development increased significantly, as planned, to € 9,078 million (2023: € 7,755 million/+17.1%). The R&D ratio for the full year was 6.4% (2023: 5.0%). As planned, the BMW Group’s capital expenditure for the full year climbed to € 9,056 million (2023: € 8,836 million/+2.5%). The capex ratio for the 12-month period rose to 6.4% (2023: 5.7%). The company expects its investments in future projects to decrease, starting in 2025.

Group earnings (EBT) in line with adjusted guidance

In 2024, the BMW Group reported Group earnings before tax (EBT) of €10,971 million (2023: € 17,096 million/-35.8%). The Group EBT margin came in at 7.7% (2023: 11.0%). In the fourth quarter of 2024, the BMW Group earned a margin of 5.8% (Q4/ 2023: 8.6%). Group net profit amounted to € 7,678 million (2023: € 12,165 million/-36.9%).

Automotive Segment EBIT margin at 6.3%

Automotive Segment earnings before financial result (EBIT) totalled € 7,893 million in 2024 (2023: € 12,981 million/ -39.2%). In the second half of 2024, in particular, the operating result was impacted by the market situation in China and delivery stops linked to Integrated Braking System (IBS). The EBIT margin came in at 6.3% (2023: 9.8%), which was within the adjusted target range of 6-7%. Excluding depreciation and amortisation for BBA assets from the purchase price allocation, the EBIT margin was 7.4%. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the segment earned a margin of 5.5% – excluding the BBA depreciation, EBT totalled approx. € 2.2 billion in the final quarter of the year, with an EBT margin of 6.5%.

The Automotive Segment’s free cash flow for the full year totalled € 4,852 million (2023: € 6,942 million) – despite realized future investments of € 18.2 bn. Largely due to a planned significant reduction in inventories, the BMW Group achieved a free cash flow of € 5,043 million in the fourth quarter (2023: € 1,183 million/+326%). In 2025, the segment’s free cash flow is expected to benefit from lower capital expenditure and land above €5 billion.

In the Financial Services Segment , the BMW Group reported solid growth in the number of new contracts with retail customers for new and used vehicles in 2024, with a significantly higher financing volume per contract. The penetration rate new BMW Group vehicles leased or financed by the Financial Services Segment climbed to 42.6%duringthe reporting year (2023: 38.2%/ +4.4 percentage points).

Earnings before tax (EBT) for the full year 2024 amounted to € 2,538 million (2023: € 2,962 million/-14.3%). Earnings development reflected the expected lowerincome from the resale of end-of-lease vehicles year-on-year, which nevertheless remains positive on average per vehicle. Additionally, earnings were impacted by higher provisions for credit and residual value risks, and additional allocations to provisions.

Higher payout ratio – dividend of € 4.30 proposed

Accounting for the payout ratio target range of 30 40% of net profit attributable to the shareholders of BMW AG and subject to the approval of the Annual General Meeting on 14 May 2025, thecompany’s unappropriated profit (according to the German Commercial Code) of € 2,677 million (2023: € 3,802 million/-29.6%) will be distributed to shareholders from BMW AG’s net profit. This represents the highest ever payout ratio of 36.7% (2023: 33.7%). Accordingly, the Board of Management and Supervisory Board will propose a dividend of € 4.30 per share of common stock (2023: € 6.00) and € 4.32 per share of preferred stock (2023: € 6.02). This makes the dividend for fiscal year 2024 the fourth highest in the company’s history.

In addition, share buybacks remain a solid pillar of the shareholder return strategy. Since authorization by the 2022 Annual General Meeting, the BMW Group has acquired a total of 6.35% of the share capital as of [ADDRESS], 2024. By April 2025, the company will have purchased a total of 4 billion euros in shares. At the Annual General Meeting on [ADDRESS], BMW AG will request a further authorization to buy back additional shares amounting to 10 percent of the existing share capital within the next five years.

“The BMW Group has consistently implemented its shareholder return strategy, even in the challenging financial year 2024. The highest payout ratio ever agreed in the history of BMW AG results in a dividend of €4.30 . In addition to our reliable annual dividends, our shareholders benefit from our share buyback programmes. Of course, our employees also benefit from the company’s success: They participate in it through our profit-sharing scheme and discounted share purchase options,” said CFO Mertl .

Number of employees higher year-on-year

The BMW Group employed 159,104 employees at the end of 2024 (2023: 154,950/ +2.7%). This slight increase in employee numbers was, as planned, due to the ramp-up of the NEUE KLASSE, primarily in development, IT and the BMW Group’s global production network.

Detailed guidance for financial year 2025

The BMW Group anticipates the following developments during financial year 2025: Inflation continues to stabilize and further moderate interest rate cuts in many countries suggest that demand will rise slightly in 2025. With the full availability of new models — the BMW 5 Series, the BMW X3 and the renewed MINI model range, as well as the new BMW 2 Series Gran Coupé — the company expects slight growth in sales overall. The share of all-electric vehicles in deliveries will increase slightly compared to 2024.

The electrification and digitization strategy will continue in 2025; however, costs and investments are expected to decline after the 2024 peak. At the same time, the continued challenging situation in China, tariff increases and ongoing support measures for the supply chain are expected to provide headwinds.

This guidance takes into account the effects of the tariff increases that came into force up to [ADDRESS]. In view of the aforementioned aspects, Group earnings before taxes will beexpected on previous year’s level*** . An EBIT margin in the range of 5.0 to 7.0% is expectedin the Automotive segment . The Automotive Segment RoCE should be within a range of 9 to 13%.

RoE in the Financial Services segment is forecast to be in the range of 13 to 16%.

In the Motorcycles Segment , a slight increase in sales and an EBIT margin within the target range of 5.5 to 7.5%are forecast, with an RoCE of 13 to 17%.

The above targets will be achieved with the current number of employees .

The actual business performance of BMW Group may deviate from current expectations, i.e. due to changes in political and macroeconomic conditions. Among other things, the currently anticipated intensification of global trade conflicts, in the form of further tariff increases, could have a negative impact.

GLOSSARY – explanatory comments on key performance indicators

Deliveries to customers

A new or used vehicle is recorded as a delivery once it is handed over to the end user (which also includes leaseholders under lease contracts with BMW Financial Services). In the US and Canada, end users also include (1) dealers when they designate a vehicle as a service loaner or demonstrator vehicle and (2) dealers and other third parties when they purchase a company vehicle at auction and dealers when they purchase company vehicles directly from the BMW Group. Deliveries may be made by BMW AG, one of its international subsidiaries, a BMW Group retail outlet, or independent third-party dealers. The vast majority of deliveries – and hence the reporting of deliveries to the BMW Group – is made by independent third-party dealers. Retail vehicle deliveries during a given reporting period do not correlate directly to the revenues that the BMW Group recognises in respect of that particular reporting period.

Payout ratio

The payout ratio is preliminary. Although the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board will propose a fixed dividend per share at the Annual General Meeting, the number of shares entitled to a dividend is expected to fall by the Annual General Meeting due to the ongoing share buy-back programme. Accordingly, the total amount to be distributed to shareholders by 14 May is also still expected to change.

Profit before financial result. Profit before financial result comprises revenues less cost of sales, less selling and administrative expenses and plus/minus net other operating income and expenses.

EBIT margin

Profit/loss before financial result as a percentage of revenues.

EBIT plus financial result.

Plug-in-hybrid electric vehicle - hybrid vehicle with petrol engine and electric drive.

# The ‘Heart’ Beats: Energy Center Completed
## +++ BMW Group Plant Irlbach-Straßkirchen: Energy Centre and Fire Station completed after only 14 months of construction +++ Supplies production and buildings with heat, cooling, compressed air and electricity +++ No use of fossil fuels +++ Fire brigade on site 24/7 for safety +++
Date: 2025-10-02 | Author: Barbara Haubner BMW Group | ID: T0453113EN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Irlbach-Straßkirchen. Construction of BMW Group’s new high-voltage battery assembly plant in the municipalities of Irlbach and Straßkirchen (Straubing-Bogen district) is progressing at high speed.

“With the completion of the Energy Centre building and the fire station, we have reached the next important milestone on the road to serial production for the new generation 6 high-voltage batteries here in Lower Bavaria,” says Sabrina Kugler, Project Manager for Plant Construction Irlbach-Straßkirchen. “The Energy Centre supplies the new plant with all the essential utilities. In addition, there are around 3,000 square metres with optimal conditions for the fire department.”

For safety: Fire service on duty 24/7

In June, the BMW fire brigade began its around-the-clock duty on the BMW Group Irlbach-Straßkirchen site. With five service vehicles and 26 people working in shifts, the fire service will ensure the safety of employees at the site. The accreditation process as a plant fire brigade is currently underway.

The team comprises experienced colleagues from other BMW Group sites in Bavaria as well as newly trained plant firefighters recruited from the region. Two of the new employees are also active in the volunteer fire departments in Irlbach and Straßkirchen. Training events and exercises continue to be closely coordinated with the nearby municipal fire brigades.

Central control unit for all essential resources

For Silvia Meyer, Head of Real Estate Management at the Irlbach-Straßkirchen plant, the Energy Centre is the “heart” of the new high-voltage battery assembly plant. “Here future production and the ancillary buildings are supplied with all necessary media – electricity, cooling, heat, cooling water and compressed air.” The utility media are controlled in the so-called Operations Centre. The building’s heating, ventilation, air conditioning and lighting are controlled automatically and resource-efficiently via the energy control technology installed there. With the help of sensors, all key production facilities and rooms are continuously monitored and visualised in real time on the control room screens.

Waste heat from production used for heating

Waste heat from the production processes is used to heat the canteen, storage and ancillary buildings at low temperatures. To do this, heat pumps in the Energy Centre convert the roughly 23°C chilled water heated by the production plants into heating energy at about 60°C. Four heat pumps, each with 1.8 MW, guarantee fault-tolerant heating capacity.

The entire piping system of the Energy Centre extends over 3.8 kilometres and is initially filled with 500,000 litres of water. The production and assembly process for high-voltage batteries requires no water. Drinking water at the site is used only for kitchens and washbasins. Rainwater collected on the roofs is used for toilets.

Highly automated production process requires compressed air

The highly automated material-handling technology in the production process for high-voltage batteries continuously requires compressed air. The energy center supplies compressed air at 6 bar to the systems in the production. Two redundant compressors cover base load, and a variable compressor covers peak load. The waste heat from the compressors is also fed into the cooling-water circuit and again available for heating the factory via the heat pumps.

Plant runs exclusively on renewable electricity

Although a natural gas pipeline runs across the site, the energy supply for the BMW Group Plant Irlbach-Straßkirchen in regular operation relies entirely on non-fossil energy sources. The plant is not connected to the natural gas pipeline.

At the new site, electricity is generated from solar energy to cover part of the total power demand. A photovoltaic installation will be installed on a roof area of around 62,000 square metres. The extent is more than a third of the roof area of the future production building, i.e. about the size of nine football pitches. The PV system will be installed and operated by the energy supplier VERBUND. Construction will begin in spring 2026, allowing it to be commissioned in time for the start of serial production. [ADDRESS],000 photovoltaic modules can deliver over 6 MW peak (MWp) and thus generate more than 6,000 MWh per year. Any additional external electricity required will come entirely from renewable sources.

The electrical supply of the assembly plant will be provided via underground 110 kV cables connected to a substation operated by Bayernwerk Netz GmbH in Irlbach, which is currently under construction. Until the substation is completed in 2028, a provisional 34 MW connection to the existing 110 kV high-voltage lines will ensure a stable power supply for the current construction site and the future production operation.

In addition, two own transformers with a maximum reference capacity of 68 MW have been installed on the site near the Energy Centre. They initially convert the 110 kV supply to 20 kV for distribution on the site. Transformers located close to consumption provide the 230 V and 400 V supplies.

Radio mast secures mobile phone coverage

The Energy Centre also plays a key role in the plant’s mobile phone coverage: a radio mast on the roof of the Energy Centre provides mobile coverage for the outdoor areas of the site. Inside the plant, around 220 antennas have already been installed in various buildings, and more than 9.5 kilometres of RF cable and 3.5 kilometres of fibre optic cable have been laid to ensure coverage across the entire site.

Digital planning tool BIM accelerates construction progress

The approximately 10,400 square metre building for the Energy Centre and Fire Station was completed in just under 14 months.

A key contributor to this short construction period was Building Information Modelling (BIM), a digital planning method. BMW Group applies the BIM approach consistently in all planning and realisation processes for the new Plant Irlbach-Straßkirchen. The system networks data and workflows of all project participants from planning through construction to operation.

The use of BIM ensures that all project participants have access to the current planning status. The method helps identify and optimise interfaces between all project participants at an early stage. An autonomous drone is used to continuously compare the current construction progress (as-built) with the digital building model (as-planned). Deviations are identified quickly so that corresponding measures can be taken. BIM is thus a fundamental component for a smooth commissioning, acceptance and handover (IAÜ process) of the buildings and systems.

# ROLLS-ROYCE SPECTRE BAILEY: A JOYFUL TRIBUTE TO A BELOVED DOG
## Rolls-Royce Motor Cars introduces Spectre Bailey, a charming tribute to the commissioning clients’ beloved dog, a Labrador-Golden Retriever mix, and the joyful life they share. Created for a long-standing Rolls-Royce client couple based in the United States, Spectre Bailey demonstrates the power of Bespoke in creating a truly memorable motor car with enduring personal meaning.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“We are lifelong car enthusiasts, yes, but we are also lifelong animal lovers, and our dog Bailey is a cherished member of our family. When we started our Rolls-Royce Spectre commission, we saw the opportunity to create something beautiful which would remind us of him for decades to come. Working with the Rolls-Royce Bespoke Collective, we were surprised at every turn with their wonderful ideas – the wood inlay, or the paw prints on the sill – which added so much to the experience. Spectre Bailey is everything we hoped for and more; it’s a joyful tribute to our loyal companion.” Commissioning Clients, Rolls-Royce Spectre Bailey “For Rolls-Royce, one of the great joys of a Bespoke commission is becoming immersed in the client’s world and the unique story behind their vision. This is perfectly captured by Spectre Bailey, a charming commission that reaffirms that inspiration can come from anywhere. Our team was absolutely delighted to collaborate with our long-standing clients to bring this concept to life in a playful yet timeless manner, reflecting the special place Bailey holds in their hearts.” Phil Fabre de la Grange, Head of Bespoke, Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Rolls-Royce Motor Cars introduces Spectre Bailey, a charming tribute to the commissioning clients’ beloved dog, a Labrador-Golden Retriever mix, and the joyful life they share. Created for a long-standing Rolls-Royce client couple based in the United States, Spectre Bailey demonstrates the power of Bespoke in creating a truly memorable motor car with enduring personal meaning. BESPOKE PAINT FOR SPECTRE BAILEY: A COAT OF CHARACTER For Spectre Bailey, paint specialists at the Home of Rolls-Royce in Goodwood developed an iridescent two-tone finish, combining paint colours reserved exclusively for the commissioning clients. The main body is finished in Crystal Fusion over Beautiful Bailey, a hue inspired by the soft fur on Bailey’s ear; the upper section gleams in Crystal Fusion, a dynamic, iridescent finish that shifts subtly with the light. The shoulder Coachline features an exact reproduction of Bailey’s paw print, hand-painted in Rose Gold to match the Spirit of Ecstasy figurine. INTERIOR SUITE: UNIQUE FROM NOSE TO TAIL The interior of Spectre Bailey is presented in Moccasin and Crème Light leather, beautifully complemented by Dark Spice and Casden Tan accents, reminiscent of Bailey’s fur colour. The wood surfaces are finished in High Gloss Royal Walnut veneer. The centrepiece of the interior is a lifelike marquetry portrait of Bailey, positioned on the waterfall between the rear seats. The intricate composition took more than four months to complete and comprises more than 180 pieces of veneer. To capture the warmth and texture of Bailey’s coat, the artisan explored a rich spectrum of natural veneers, experimenting with grain direction, tone, and texture. Each sheet was chosen for its natural hue and pattern, with no staining or artificial treatment. Bailey’s tongue alone was crafted using four veneers never previously employed by Rolls-Royce – Purple Heart, Tulipwood, Louro Faia, and Pear – selected for their subtle colour variations. In total, nine veneers were used, representing 22 natural shades, to create a portrait of remarkable warmth and realism. On the passenger side of the dashboard, a smaller marquetry motif offers another tribute to Bailey, depicting a precise recreation of his paw print. This design also appears as an engraving on the surround of the Bespoke Rose Gold treadplates on the door sills, revealed in a moment of quiet delight when the doors are opened. SPECTRE BAILEY: A LASTING TRIBUTE TO A LOYAL FRIEND Spectre Bailey is a joyful expression of devotion, handcrafted with precision, quiet whimsy and affection. It’s a motor car that celebrates a beloved companion, and the boundless possibilities of Bespoke.

Bathurst. What a race, what a victory! Team WRT achieved an impressive 1-2 result with the BMW M4 GT3 at the [ADDRESS] Hour (AUS), the season opener of the Intercontinental GT Challenge (IGTC). Brothers Sheldon and Kelvin van der Linde (both RSA) triumphed alongside Augusto Farfus (BRA) in car #32. Following them, Valentino Rossi (ITA), Raffaele Marciello (SUI), and Charles Weerts (BEL) in the #46 BMW M4 GT3 secured second place. It was the first victory for BMW M Motorsport in the GT3 era at the Mount Panorama Circuit. Team WRT remains undefeated in the 2025 season after successes at the 24h Dubai and the 6h Abu Dhabi (both UAE). On the sidelines of the race at Bathurst, the new BMW M3 CS Touring (fuel consumption combined: 10.5 l/100 km [26.9 mpg imp]; CO 2 emissions combined: 238 g/km in the WLTP cycle, CO 2 class: G)* celebrated its world premiere .

Team WRT owed its 1-2 finish primarily to a perfect race strategy. Throughout the race, the two BMW M4 GT3s consistently gained an advantage in fuel consumption, which ultimately decided victory or defeat. While most competitors had to pit for refuelling just before the end, both BMW M4 GT3s were able to continue without stopping. Car #46 temporarily fell back to eighth place due to a drive-through penalty but fought its way back onto the podium. Marciello secured second place with a spectacular overtaking manoeuvre against Jules Gounon (AND, Mercedes).

BMW M Motorsport won at Bathurst for the first time after numerous attempts since GT3 cars have been competing there. The last triumph dates back to 2010 with a BMW 335i. For the Van der Linde brothers, it was their first joint victory in a BMW M Motorsport car, and for Rossi, it was his first podium at the [ADDRESS] Hour.

World premiere of the new BMW M3 CS Touring.

Born on the racetrack, made for the street: BMW M’s philosophy came to life on Thursday ahead of the [ADDRESS] Hour. In the Mount Panorama Circuit pit lane, the first-ever BMW M3 CS Touring celebrated its world premiere, presented by Sylvia Neubauer, Vice President Customer, Brand, and Sales at BMW M GmbH. The iconic racetrack provided the perfect stage for the debut of the latest BMW M special-edition model in the high-performance sports car sector. A 405 kW/550 hp six-cylinder in-line engine, bespoke chassis tuning, exclusive design features and weight savings resulting from the use of numerous carbon fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP) components provide the ingredients for an unadulterated racing-car feel.

Reactions after the [ADDRESS] Hour:

Andreas Roos, Head of BMW M Motorsport: “Congratulations to Team WRT on the long-awaited Bathurst victory! It was our third attempt with the BMW M4 GT3, and after coming close last year, we finally made it! I am very happy for the Van der Linde brothers that they can celebrate a victory in their first race sharing a car for BMW M Motorsport. I am also pleased for Augusto Farfus, who can add another prestigious triumph to his illustrious career as a BMW M works driver. Valentino Rossi, Raffaele Marciello, and Charles Weerts also did a great job in the sister car. It's a pity that a penalty cost them a chance of victory. Team WRT remains undefeated this year after victories at the 24h Dubai and the 6h Abu Dhabi. Hopefully, this is a good omen for the rest of the season! Thank you to all the drivers, team members, and BMW M Motorsport employees who made this outstanding season start possible.”

Vincent Vosse, Team Principal Team WRT: “Three races, three wins. What an amazing start of the season! We tried to win at Bathurst with BMW M Motorsport for the last two years, but it never worked out. This time, everything was just spot on. This is a big race everyone wants to win, so I could not be happier. A special congrats goes to Kelvin van der Linde, who in only his second race with BMW M Motorsport achieved maybe his biggest win yet together with his brother. The #46 crew also did an excellent job coming back in the race and finishing just ten seconds behind.”

Sheldon van der Linde (#32 BMW M4 GT3, 1 st place): “I am very, very happy! I think this victory was down to excellent execution of the guys at Team WRT. I don’t think I have ever seen such a perfet execution in terms of strategy before. We did not have the outright fastest car today, but still we did it! Both my teammates didn’t make any mistakes. Sharing this win with my brother for the first time since 2018, is very special of course. I’m really impressed how quickly he is up there with his pace in just his second race with BMW M Motorsport.”

Kelvin van der Linde (#32 BMW M4 GT3, 1 st place): “This was a race with a crazy amount of emotions for me. First race back with Team WRT, first race back with my brother, first race with Augusto, second race for BMW m Motorsport. This is all very special. I don’t have to explain, what this win means for my brother and myself. I’m sure, mom and dad are proud at home. It’s also amazing for me to share this victory with Augusto, whom I looked up to when I was a kid. He was one of my heroes. Looking at the race, the final stint was very tough, as I had to hit fuel numbers and had Chaz Mostert behind me catching up. But in the end, it worked out perfectly.”

Augusto Farfus (#32 BMW M4 GT3, 1 st place): “I’m a very lucky guy to be with BMW M Motorsport for such a long time. We came here many times and never were lucky enough to win. This time, we thought we had a chance – and we executed a perfect race. To put my name in the history books of this event now is very emotional. During the final 40 minutes we just hoped for a green end, as a safety car would have ruined our race. Luckily it all went well in the end. Thanks a lot to BMW M Motorsport, Team WRT and my teammates who did a perfect job.”

Valentino Rossi (#46 BMW M4 GT3, 2 nd place): “This podium is a fantastic way to start the season. The whole weekend was great, as we were always strong and competitive. We were able to fight with our sister car until I made a mistake unfortunately and we had to serve a drive-through penalty. I tought at that point, that the fight for the podium was over. But we managed to come back with great pace. Raffaele’s pass against Jules Gounon was a lot of fun to watch. I am very happy with the result.”

Raffaele Marciello (#46 BMW M4 GT3, 2 nd place): “A 1-2 is a great result for the team. I know they have tried to win it for a long time, and now it finally worked out. Not for me personally, so I will still have to wait for my first victory here after a couple of podium finishes. It was a good fight with Jules Gounon. I knew I had the faster car on the straights, and when there was a slower car in front of us, I took the opportunity and attacked him. It was a good move. ”

Charles Weerts (#46 BMW M4 GT3, 2 nd place): “Huge congrats to our sister car. They were really quick all week and really deserve this win. For BMW M Motorsport it has been a long time trying to win here, so this 1-2 is pretty big for them and also for the entire Team WRT. Their strategy was absolute masterclass today. The overall result is great, but next time I hope we can swap positions.”

# Thrilling victory at Aragón.
## +++ 13th consecutive win: Toprak Razgatlioglu ties his own WorldSBK record on the BMW M 1000 RR on Saturday. +++ Two second-place finishes for the championship leader from the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team on Sunday. +++ Michael van der Mark also shows strong race pace at Aragón. +++

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alcañiz. The tenth race weekend of the 2025 FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) at MotorLand Aragón (ESP) was all about thrilling battles between championship leader Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR) and runner-up Nicolò Bulega (ITA / Ducati). Starting from first and second on the grid, the two riders delivered breathtaking duels in all three races, keeping the nearly 30,000 spectators on the edge of their seats. In the first main race on Saturday afternoon, Razgatlioglu on the BMW M 1000 RR of the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team came out on top and celebrated his 13th consecutive victory. With this, he tied his own record set during the 2024 season. It was also Razgatlioglu’s first-ever win at MotorLand Aragón.

In the Superpole Race and in the second main race on Sunday, Bulega narrowly came out ahead each time, with Razgatlioglu finishing second on the podium in both races. In the championship standings, Razgatlioglu leads with 36 points over Bulega with two events remaining in the season. In the manufacturers’ standings, BMW is in second place, just six points behind Ducati.

Teammate Michael van der Mark (NED) continued his strong form from France at MotorLand Aragón. He finished tenth in the first race and secured the important ninth place in the Superpole Race, starting from the third row for the final second main race on Sunday. There, he was in eighth place on the last lap but unfortunately crashed and retired. The WorldSBK season will conclude with a double-header in October: first at Estoril, Portugal (10th to 12th October) and then the finale at Jerez de la Frontera, Spain (17th to 19th October).

Reactions after the MotorLand Aragón round.

Sven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “We are very positive about this weekend. We collected many important points here wt Aragón. Our goal was to win at this Ducati track, and we achieved that on Saturday with Toprak. On Sunday, we couldn’t beat a flawless Nicolò Bulega, but with two second-place finishes we achieved more excellent results. Mickey also had a generally good weekend. He is back and capable of fighting for the top ten or even the top five. The crash at the end was unfortunate, but overall we can build on this performance. Now we move on to Estoril in the title fight, where we also want to continue competing in the manufacturers’ championship. We had already had a taste of that title fight here when we led after Saturday’s win. We are confident that as a team we will perform well with both riders at Estoril.”

Christian Gonschor, Technical Director BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “It was a fantastic weekend. We knew that Ducati was the clear favourite here. The track suits their package particularly well but we put up an excellent fight. The races were thrilling, and it was clear: the decision comes down to the last corner. Here, Nicolò and his bike were in a class of their own. On Saturday, Toprak was able to make his way through with a strong manoeuvre and the victory was a wonderful gift for all of us. Sunday was incredibly close as well. Overall, however, we got the maximum out of this weekend. The entire team once again delivered outstanding work and set up the BMW M 1000 RR so that, on a track that doesn’t really favour us, we were absolutely on par. Now we move into the season finale full of motivation. We are more than ready!”

Toprak Razgatlioglu, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “Saturday’s victory was very important for me. I had never won here before and I am very happy that I now have my first victory at Aragón under my belt. The races here have been very hard, I was battling with Nicolò all the time but I also enjoyed that. In the second race, I then made a mistake in turn 7 and he could pull a bit of a gap. But even if I had continued to battle with him, my chance to take the win would have been very small because the Ducati had a big advantage in the last corner, it had better grip there, the bike was turning and accelerating well. They have a good package for Aragón. In the races, I tried everything, and I hope everyone enjoyed it! I did my best this weekend, I was very motivated, especially after I won the first race. That was very good for me. Overall, I am not so sad because I knew that Aragón is not a BMW but a Ducati track. We did a very good job, strong races, and it has been a very positive weekend for me. Not for 100 per cent, but I am happy. Now we are going to Estoril, we will see there. Nicolò is strong there, but I am, too.”

Michael van der Mark, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “Overall, the weekend was quite good. From the very first practice, I had a good feeling on the bike. In Superpole it wasn’t quite enough for the front rows, but in the first main race I made it into the top ten. The most important thing was that for Sunday I knew what I could still improve, and together with the team we had some ideas regarding the setup. Tyre wear is quite high here, but we managed that well. In the Superpole Race I really wanted to move up to the ninth position, and I succeeded. In race two I was also able to ride consistently and fight. My goal was to get back into the top five, but we were missing a bit of pace for that. At least I was back in the top eight, but then unfortunately I had a crash on the last lap. Sorry to the team for that. All in all though, I’m optimistic for Estoril and Jerez.”

# PHANTOM AT 100: REFLECTING AND SHAPING THE WORLD THROUGH BESPOKE
## Since the launch of the first Phantom in May 1925, motor cars bearing this storied nameplate have enabled their owner to create something entirely unique and personal to them. Through the Bespoke details they commissioned, Rolls-Royce Phantom clients have also expressed the values, priorities and aesthetics of their time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“The story of Phantom’s first 100 years is uniquely human, told through the Bespoke details commissioned by generations of clients. The evolution of their requests, richly detailed here, reflects profound shifts in society, culture and technology. It also highlights Phantom’s unique capacity to capture its owner’s personal tastes and desires – a quality that continues to draw clients to the marque, and indeed to Phantom itself, today.” Chris Brownridge, Chief Executive, Rolls-Royce Motor Cars

PHANTOM’S CULTURAL LEGACY: A 100-YEAR STORY TOLD THROUGH BESPOKE Since the launch of the first Phantom in May 1925, motor cars bearing this storied nameplate have enabled their owner to create something entirely unique and personal to them. Through the Bespoke details they commissioned, Rolls-Royce Phantom clients have also expressed the values, priorities and aesthetics of their time. Tracing Phantom’s evolution shows how these have shifted – sometimes subtly, often profoundly – over the past 100 years. Yet Phantom remains a constant: the perfect canvas for individualisation and self-expression. In its early years, Phantom was supplied as a rolling chassis, on which the owner commissioned bodywork from a specialist coachbuilder. Many of the examples referenced here stand as monuments to the art of these superlative craftspeople – one that was almost lost entirely, until Rolls-Royce initiated a spectacular present-day revival at Goodwood through its Coachbuild department.

POWER AND PRESTIGE: PHANTOM AS A SYMBOL OF INFLUENCE As the largest, most imposing and unashamedly luxurious Rolls-Royce model, Phantom immediately became the instinctive choice of royalty, heads of state and other dignitaries as a way to project their status and influence.

PRIVACY AND EXCLUSIVITY: THE EVOLUTION OF PERSONAL SPACE In stark contrast to their modern counterparts, these high-ranking early 20th century Phantom owners were generally remote figures, rarely seen and largely unknown to the public. A Bespoke Phantom was the perfect means to preserve their mystique, reinforcing their status while giving them complete control over their exposure to the public eye. Many Phantoms featured rear cabins fitted with privacy curtains – a feature still available today. They were especially popular in India, where so-called ‘purdah’ motor cars were fitted with thick curtains to screen passengers from outside observation. Other exalted owners took a more direct, mechanical approach to maintaining their distance; a Phantom IV made for the British Royal Family had rear seats that were adjustable back and forth, so occupants could slide themselves in and out of view as the situation demanded. This royal motor car’s successor, Phantom V, featured a transparent Perspex dome, giving the same visibility as an open car. Once necessary appearances were concluded, a two-piece aluminium cover, stowed in the luggage compartment, could be secured over the top to provide complete privacy.

CONFIDENCE AND CONFIDENTIALITY: PHANTOM AND THE AGE OF FAME As the 20th century progressed, increasing public interest in prominent people’s lives, fuelled by the growth of mass media, made Phantom’s role as a sanctuary even more important. Celebrity owners frequently specified tinted rear windows: among the first cars in Britain to be equipped with them was the Phantom V commissioned by John Lennon in 1965. Whether public figures or private clients, many Phantom owners used their motor cars to hold confidential discussions. There are numerous examples of Phantoms fitted with a soundproofed partition incorporating electric communication controls, so the rear-seat passengers could communicate with the chauffeur when necessary, but could not be overheard at other times. This feature is still available today with the marque’s Privacy Suite. Secrecy and discretion could take other forms. In 1928, Otto Oppenheimer, a British businessman who ran the London operations of the De Beers diamond company, specified his Phantom I, known as ‘The Black Diamond’, with a secret compartment to transport uncut diamonds. Its location was known only to him, coachbuilder Hooper & Co. and Rolls-Royce. Almost a century later, this motor car’s beauty and mystique were reaffirmed when it was named overall winner of the prestigious Cartier Style et Luxe Concours at the 2025 Goodwood Festival of Speed.

EXTRAVAGANCE TO UNDERSTATEMENT: THE CHANGING FACE OF LUXURY While Phantom has long been the preferred motor car of the world’s wealthiest people, how they choose to express their success continually evolves. When Phantom debuted in 1925, the Art Deco movement was at its peak. The influence of this sleek industrial aesthetic, built on sharp geometric shapes and gleaming metallic surfaces, is clearly visible in Phantom III, launched in 1936. One example even featured polished copper wings, and many more incorporated decorative Art Deco flashes and motifs. These commissions offer a vivid insight into the period’s perceptions of luxury, which leaned towards the lavish and opulent, with gold-plated brightwork, gold and silver inlays and interior fittings, intricate marquetry, exotic wood veneers, and soft furnishings finished in materials such as astrakhan wool and damask. One of the most extravagant commissions was ‘The Phantom of Love’, created in 1926 by Clarence Gasque, finance director of Woolworths UK stores, as a gift for his wife, Maude. Inspired by an 18th century sedan chair in the Victoria & Albert Museum, the interior was conceived as a tribute to her passion for French design and history. With an unlimited budget, Wolverhampton coachbuilders Charles Clark & Sons created an interior worthy of Versailles, complete with Aubusson tapestry upholstery, a hand-painted ceiling with gilded cornices, and a Louis XIV-style drinks cabinet topped with an ormolu clock and porcelain vases of gilded metal and enamel flowers. This was a time when some of the most spectacularly eccentric commissions in Rolls-Royce history were brought to life. Gerald Tyrwhitt, 14th Baron Berners — famous for dyeing pigeons in a variety of pastel hues at his Oxfordshire estate — specified a clavichord keyboard beneath the front seat. Mrs E. Churchill-Wylie went further still, commissioning a Phantom equipped with a bar, gramophone, picnic set, writing desk, cigar cabinet and boot-mounted wash basin. The following decades saw a shift toward more understated commissions, where material provenance and quality spoke louder than decoration. William Playne Twill – an English take on Scottish tweed – was popular for its handsome, pinstriped finish. Though no longer in production, it remains highly prized by collectors. Equally favoured was ‘West of England’ cloth, sourced from traditional woollen mills in the South West of England and offered in a wide variety of colours. Her Majesty the Queen favoured Light Grey and Baroda Blue in her Phantoms of the 1950s and 60s.

LEISURE AND ENTERTAINMENT: THE MOTOR CAR AS A SOCIAL SPACE Favoured by crowned heads and the international elite, Phantom quickly became a fixture of high society. Its first decade was defined by Art Deco elegance — what followed introduced a more discreet kind of indulgence. For clients in the United States, this was the era of Prohibition. For those with sufficient thirst and imagination, Phantom could offer some relief. Several socialites – including one of the biggest stars of the silent movie era – specified a secret compartment to transport liquor in defiance of the law; one Phantom II Continental had what the order coyly described as a ‘cocktail set’ concealed in the C-pillar. With the repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment in December 1933, drinks cabinets were more openly commissioned, displayed and enjoyed. That spirit of celebration continues today, with Rolls-Royce offering a wide array of Bespoke accessories for those with a taste for the exceptional, including the Champagne Chest and Cocktail Hamper. This ethos is woven into the very fabric of the contemporary Phantom: its Champagne Cooler features two distinct settings, precisely calibrated for vintage and non-vintage cuvées. Of course, entertainment was not limited to the liquid kind. Bespoke features commissioned beyond Prohibition reflected developments in technology as well as society. Phantom II 18GX is known to have been equipped with a wind-up gramophone; from the 1930s, radios were widely specified in Phantom III and its successors. In the 1960s, Phantom V 5LVA33 was among the first Rolls-Royce motor cars to be fitted with a television, at a time when just one in four British homes owned one. Through the 1960s and 70s, television would also transform the careers and profiles of a new generation of rock and pop superstars, for whom Phantom was the only choice. These motor cars included some of the era’s most sophisticated and potent in-car audio systems, providing a template for today’s meticulously engineered Bespoke Audio system. However, one feature – a microphone fitted for Elvis Presley – has the unique distinction of only ever being requested once.

A CONTEMPORARY CANVAS: THE GOODWOOD ERA Phantom commissions in Rolls-Royce’s early Goodwood era drew inspiration from an increasingly wide range of themes, reflecting the global nature of the reenergised brand and the diverse lives and passions of clients around the world. One Phantom VII commission in particular marked a watershed moment, challenging Rolls-Royce to push its Bespoke capabilities beyond craftsmanship and into the realm of art. Phantom Serenity combines imperial silk, fine embroidery and hand-painting — the latter requiring artisans to undergo specialist training — to reimagine the rear suite as a garden sanctuary beneath flowering trees. The response was instant and global: Serenity had expanded the definition of luxury. A similarly defining moment was the unveiling of Phantom Drophead Coupé Waterspeed. Celebrated today as an expression of the marque’s own history and values, this motor car pays tribute to Sir Malcolm Campbell’s record-breaking feats in the Rolls-Royce-powered Bluebird K3 boat. Its striking Maggiore Blue paint finish, brushed steel deck and open-pore Abachi wood interior signalled a new era of creative and technical confidence within the Bespoke Collective. These motor cars inspired more clients than ever to bring increasingly ambitious ideas to the marque. Among the many Bespoke Phantoms that Rolls-Royce has been graciously permitted to share with the world is Phantom Syntopia, a collaboration with Dutch fashion designer Iris van Herpen. Inspired by the intricate layering techniques of haute couture, this one-of-one commission included a silk headliner that took almost 700 collective hours to complete — as well as its own unique fragrance. Phantom Scintilla, meanwhile, draws its creative energy from the marque’s own mythology. Designed to capture the fleeting wonder of the Spirit of Ecstasy figurine’s presence, it incorporates Bespoke features inspired by the apparent movement of ‘Eleanor’s’ robes. These include expansive interior embroideries comprising 869,500 stitches, and an animated Starlight Headliner completed with 4,450 perforations that reveal subtle flashes of a metallic silver fabric beneath. These motor cars represent just a glimpse of the remarkable diversity of Bespoke Phantom commissions created at Goodwood. Each is a singular response to a client’s vision, and with new inspirations drawn from ever more unexpected worlds, the next chapter promises to be even more extraordinary.

A CENTURY OF CULTURAL EXPRESSION The first century of Bespoke Phantom motor cars underlines a simple truth; as the ultimate canvas for self-expression, Phantom – more than any other motor car in history – reflects its owners, and the world and eras in which they live. Every individual example expresses and preserves the tastes, attitudes, cultural conventions and aesthetic influences of its own era – a unique work of history and art that tells a deeply personal story. Over a century of evolution, one thing has remained constant. Through Bespoke, Phantom is not only the best car in the world: it is the best car for its owner and their world.

MINI is set to launch Agents of Fun – a cinematic new campaign fronted by actor, producer, and Golden Globe–nominated Jack Lowden, reimagining the car advert as something entirely different: a sharp, espionage-inspired short film with subversive wit and cultural edge. It marks a return to narrative-led advertising – where story drives impact, rules are playfully bent, and the MINI John Cooper Works shares the spotlight as a protagonist in its own right. Lowden’s involvement underscores the campaign’s cultural credibility and sense of timing. In both tone and execution, it reflects the resurgence of the espionage thriller – a genre increasingly set in the UK, particularly London. At the heart of these stories lies intrigue, misdirection, and a dose of underdog mischief – themes that resonate in culture right now. Agents of Fun channels that energy, offering MINI’s own playful take on the genre. Directed by Ilya Naishuller, best known for the cult action hit Nobody and the first-person thriller Hardcore Henry; and shot on 16mm film by Golden Globe–nominated cinematographer Christopher Ross (Shōgun, The Day of the Jackal), the film draws on the visual language of classic spy thrillers, refracted through a self-aware, modern British lens. Acclaimed for his layered, quietly defiant performances in Slow Horses, Benediction, and The Gold, Lowden brings grounded charisma to the campaign’s lead role: a wry, agile figure navigating a stylish world of espionage. The MINI John Cooper Works (JCW) plays not just a supporting role, but a true on-screen accomplice - compact, fast, and deliberately hard to pin down.

# MINI and Paul Smith at the Japan Mobility Show 2025.
## MINI presents the next milestone in its cooperation with Paul Smith in Tokyo whilst showcasing their current model range.
Date: 2025-10-15 | Author: Silas Thelen BMW Group | ID: T0453349EN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Munich / Tokyo. The Japan Mobility Show 2025 becomes the stage for the latest milestone in the long-standing collaboration between MINI and British designer Paul Smith. It will be unveiled as part of the BMW Group Keynote on 29 October 2025 at 09:55 (JST) at the BMW Group stand, based in the West Exhibition Hall of the show.

MINI and Paul Smith: A creative success story.

The MINI Paul Smith Edition is a new chapter in the success story of the two British brands. The long-lasting relationship began in 1998, when the designer wrapped a Classic Mini Cooper in his trademark visual design. To mark the 40th anniversary of the Classic Mini in 1999, the designer lent his characteristic Paul Smith "Signature Stripe" to a one-off model. After two further one-offs - the MINI Strip in 2021 and the MINI Recharged by Paul Smith in 2022 - Paul Smith's design language returns to MINI.

Munich. At the Olympic Winter Games 2022, Team Germany celebrated twelve gold, ten silver, and five bronze medals. The German Bobsleigh, Luge, and Skeleton Federation (BSD) contributed the majority of them - nine golds, six silvers, and one bronze in Beijing (CHN). It was an outstanding team result that the national bobsleigh, skeleton, and luge squads are eager to repeat when the next Olympic Winter Games take place in Milan and Cortina d’Ampezzo, Italy (6–22 February 2026). Achieving that requires hard work in every area and a constant pursuit of optimisation. To this end, the BSD continues to rely on its technology partnership with the BMW Group, established in 2010.

Drawing on BMW’s expertise, technological capabilities, and innovative strength from automotive engineering and motorsport, two projects have been advanced for the 2026 Olympics - both designed to deliver those decisive fractions of a second in the ice track: the BMW Data Coach in luge and customised spike plates for bobsleigh and skeleton shoes.

Individual spike shoes for greater push-off performance.

It’s no secret that start times in bobsleigh and skeleton are crucial, as they determine the speed athletes carry into the run - there’s no “gas pedal” after that. To translate their athletic power into acceleration on ice, athletes depend on the right footwear. The force is transmitted solely through spike plates on the forefoot, with more than 250 small, sharp spikes per shoe gripping the ice and converting energy into motion. Any improvement to these plates directly enhances performance in the track.

Surprisingly, standard shoes are typically used in bobsleigh and skeleton - without considering athletes’ individual preferences or anatomical differences. The BMW Group identified optimisation potential and, together with the BSD, began developing custom spike-plate prototypes ahead of the 2022 Winter Olympics for skeleton athletes. These plates can be mounted onto any preferred track-and-field shoe using existing spike threads for secure fastening.

Manufactured at the BMW Group Additive Manufacturing Campus in Munich, the spike plates are produced using 3D printing - a process BMW has been employing since 1991 across the entire vehicle lifecycle, from concept to production and spare parts. This highly efficient process uses a specialised design software that allows fast, automated, and athlete-specific generation of 3D-print data. Parameters such as geometry, stiffness, and spike shape are customised and adapted to each athlete’s shoe using 3D scans. This algorithmic design process offers enormous time savings and maximum flexibility as plates can be printed, tested, and re-optimised in rapid cycles.

The 3D-printed spike plates made their World Cup debut last season, with teams such as Adam Ammour’s using them extensively. However, development continued - athlete feedback and summer gait analysis data revealed that some athletes performed better with softer soles and plates. As a result, a second development track was launched, strongly supported by Felix Straub, brakeman for Francesco Friedrich’s team. In this version, the plates are milled from nylon, fitted with steel spikes, and then glued and riveted to the shoe.

A key material challenge is ensuring the steel spikes withstand extreme loads without wearing or breaking. BMW specialists in materials and process engineering developed a solution: the spikes are plasma-nitrided - a hardening process in which nitrogen is ionized in a vacuum at high temperature and diffuses into the steel, improving surface hardness. BMW uses this technique for crankshafts in BMW Motorrad engines and in motorsport applications.

Now, all athletes on the German bobsleigh and skeleton teams can choose between both systems, test them extensively before the Olympics, and select their preferred option. After four years of development, the result is a range of individualised options for every athlete, foot type, shoe model, running style, and push-off position - replacing the one-size-fits-all solution.

Data-driven optimisation of material and racing line.

In luge, the interplay between athlete and sled involves many interdependent factors — optimising as many as possible for the best run time is the key challenge. The BMW Data Coach delivers a major advantage by enabling data-based analysis and optimisation of these factors. The ideal interaction varies between athletes and tracks, much like individualised car setups in motorsport. For the 2026 Games, a new ice track has been built in Cortina, with only a limited number of runs available before competition - making data-driven insights even more valuable.

Based on measurement and simulation methods, the Data Coach gives lugers new ways to fine-tune their sled setup and identify the ideal racing line. This approach is well-established in vehicle development and motorsport. Since 2016, the BMW Group and BSD have been applying and refining these methods in luge.

Special sensors installed in the sled record extensive dynamic data, allowing each run to be precisely reconstructed using dedicated analysis software. The software was developed by former Junior World Champion luger Dr. Julian von Schleinitz, now Head of Tech Excellence at the BMW Group, who combines his athletic experience with engineering expertise. Over the years, the growing dataset has made the BMW Data Coach increasingly effective in identifying optimal lines and refining sled setups.

Today, the data volume is so large that - combined with computer simulations - it allows predictive testing of new components and configurations virtually, before any physical prototype is built or a new line is tested on track. This significantly increases efficiency and insight within the complex system of sled and athlete.

For the Olympic season, the system - used extensively by 13-time World Champion Felix Loch and six-time World Champion Max Langenhan - has been further enhanced. The sensors now deliver more precise readings on wet ice, and the hardware has been miniaturised to fit into a regulation-compliant racing sled. This marks a major step forward, as the measurements now come from a sled identical to competition equipment.

During the first international training period in Cortina in late October and early November, valuable data were already collected. These will now be analysed in detail to shape the Olympic race strategy. A second test event at the Olympic track in late November will offer another opportunity for refinement - before the athletes battle for gold in February 2026, where every thousandth of a second counts.
