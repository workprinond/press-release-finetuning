H1: BMW NA 50th Anniversary | 50 Stories for 50 Years Chapter 2: “Before BMW of North America: The Max Hoffman Era” Written by: Jackie Jouret
H2: If one character could be said to dominate BMW’s early years in the US, it’s Max Hoffman.

Alas, Hoffman’s true role within BMW history is as much villain as hero, however, as it was with respect to nearly all of the marques represented at one time or another by the Hoffman Motors Corporation.

H1: BMW NA 50th Anniversary | 50 Stories for 50 Years Chapter 26: “Preserving the Past for The Future: Saving The Products That Established BMW Group’s Brand Identities in the USA.”
H2: The life cycle of an automobile has three distinct phases. First, it’s new, exciting, and perhaps expensive. A decade later, it’s out of date, with little value or allure unless it survives to the third phase. At this point, the automobile becomes ‘vintage’, and values rise once again as it becomes a treasured survivor. This is true of many BMW models, and it is especially true of race cars, which lose most of their value the moment they’re no longer competitive.
